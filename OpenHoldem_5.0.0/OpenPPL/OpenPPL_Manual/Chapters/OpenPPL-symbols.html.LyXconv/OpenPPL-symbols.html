<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Below you find a list of OpenPPL symbols. They are part of the OpenPPL
function-library, which gets added automatically by the OpenPPL-translator. Most of
these symbols work exactly the same way as their PPL counterparts. Only very few
differ, mostly for technical reasons, but some of them because we think it is better that
way. These differences are documented of course. You will also find some new symbols,
that are not part of standard PPL; some PokerTracker and stacksize symbols for
example. However: we didn&#8217;t implement everything that is possible and desireable. More
extensions are subject of the next chapter: &#8220;Building Symbols On Your Own&#8221;. Who
knows: if you come up with some good code, reasonable naming and a good
description your new symbols might become part of a future OpenPPL-release.
