\begin_layout Section
Choosing an operating system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem has been designed to work best on the 32-bit versions of Microsoftâ€™s
 Windows 2000 or Windows XP operating systems.
 Any service pack level on these two choices seems to be fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recommend you avoid 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows Vista
\end_layout

\end_inset

Vista or its dependents (
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows 7
\end_layout

\end_inset

Windows 7, etc).
 These operating systems add a lot of useless cruft and bloatware that is
 not useful in this hobby.
 Most of the poker botters you will interact with in the community use these
 systems as well, so as you learn and exchange ideas, it is useful to be
 on the same platform.
 This is especially true of Table Maps.
 A TableMap designed for 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows XP
\end_layout

\end_inset

Windows XP is not very likely to work on Vista.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, as you scale your botting operation up, you want to keep things
 as lightweight as possible to best utilize the limited computing resources
 at your disposal.
 For this reason, 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows 2000
\end_layout

\end_inset

Windows 2000 is often the choice of poker botters due to its very lean profile.
