Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you try to configure OpenHoldem to work with a Poker Tracker database,
 you must have a properly working Poker Tracker configuration set up first.
 This is not the most trivial of activities, and does have a learning curve.
 The best information on how to set up Poker Tracker can be found on the
 Poker Tracker website (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming you have a working Poker Tracker installation, let’s move on to
 getting OpenHoldem to work with your Poker Tracker database.
 OpenHoldem only works with 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PostgreSQL
\end_layout

\end_inset

PostgreSQL databases, not with 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Access database
\end_layout

\end_inset

Access databases; so if you do not have Poker Tracker configured in that
 way (and you know if you do), go back and get that set up first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so now you have Poker Tracker installed using PostgreSQL as the underlying
 database.
 Do you have Poker Tracker setup to automatically import hand histories
 into your database? If not, OpenHoldem will not be able to provide you
 any useful information, as there will be no information in your database
 to pull from.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After all of that is configured, you can use the settings in {Preferences}
 to instruct OpenHoldem how to connect to your Poker Tracker database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When connected, OpenHoldem will query the database using the 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sitename
\end_layout

\end_inset

sitename and 
\begin_inset Index

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Sitename 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything in Poker Tracker is first organized by what it calls a “site
 id”.
 When querying the database, the first thing OpenHoldem will try to do is
 associate your sitename or 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
network-name
\end_layout

\end_inset

network, as specified in the Table Map, to a Poker Tracker “
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
site
\end_layout

\end_inset

site id”.
 This is done by doing a case-insensitive substring lookup against the following
 lists.
 This means that if your sitename string is “stars10sng” it will still be
 able to associate that to the proper “site id”, as “stars” is within that
 sitename.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one of the below character strings cannot be found in either the sitename
 or network strings, as specified in your Table Map file, using a case-insensiti
ve substring search, then OpenHoldem will not be able to lookup statistics
 for the players playing at your table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a note, the sitename string is searched first, and if a match cannot
 be found there, then the network string is searched.

\begin_layout Section
Playername 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second critical piece of information that OpenHoldem needs to query
 the database is the name of the player.
 OpenHoldem gets this from the pXname/uXname regions on the Table Map.
 Note that this scraped name does not need to exactly match the name as
 stored in the database.
 This is useful, as there is currently no method for scraping spaces in
 players’ names.
 OpenHoldem will in all cases, return the statistics for an exact name match
 if it exists, and if it does not exist, will find the closest match using
 a Levenshtein distance algorithm (

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Note that Levenshtein distances that exceed one-half the length of the
 name as stored in Poker Tracker are discarded as invalid.
