Window selection:

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Manual choice: 
\emph default
The default classical method.
 If exactly one table and exactly one matching tablemap exist OpenHoldem
 will connect to that table directly, otherwise it will present a dialog
 with a list of choices for manual selection.
 This behaviour was quite inconvenient in production, but is still supported
 for backward compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Automatical choice: 
\emph default
This option will pick the first available table on every attempt to connect,
 that is not yet attached to another instance of OpenHoldem.
 If no such table is available, it will fall silently.
 If multiple tablemaps in the 
\begin_inset Index

Never: 
\emph default
The default classical method.
 If exactly one table and exactly one matching tablemap exist OpenHoldem
 will connect to that table directly, otherwise it will present a dialog
 with a list of choices for manual selection.
 This behaviour was quite inconvenient in production, but is still supported
 for backward compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Once on start: 
\emph default
This option will cause OpenHoldem to auto-connect exactly once on start.
 This setting is especially useful in combination with the option to automatical
ly choose a table.
 If no table exists, that fits to a tablemap --- or if all such tables are
 already getting served --- , it will fail silently and behave the default
 way, waiting for the green button or a connection-message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Permanent
\emph default
\noun on
: 
\noun default
This setting will cause OpenHoldem to try to auto-connect once every N seconds.
 After some refactoring OpenHoldem does now cache the connection-data of
 all known table maps and all instances of OpenHoldem are now synchronized.
 If one instance fails to connect, the other ones will be blocked for the
 next N seconds.
 So the system-load is now astonishing low, even with dozens of instances
 waiting for tables.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Time between attempts to connect
\emph default
: This option is pretty self-explanatory.
 It specifies the time to wait (in seconds) until the next attempt to connect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Close OH when table disappears: 
\emph default
This option will terminate OpenHoldem, when the poker table stops to exist,
 e.g.
 when the table got closed by the hopper or when you get moved to another
 table in a MTT.
 This method is for you, if your philosophy to do reconnects is to close
 OpenHoldem and to simply fire up another instance or if you want to easily
 shut your botting system down at the end of a session.
