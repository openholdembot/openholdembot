<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >The purpose of Hash Records is to allow for the rapid lookup of pixel patterns, without
having to scan through each pixel in a region to find a match. For example, if we have a
card region specified to use a &#8220;Hash0&#8221; transform, the screen scraper engine will first
reduce the pixels in that region to a 32-bit hash value. (A link to Bob Jenkins&#8217; hash
algorithm that is used in this project can be found in the references section)
Once the screen scraper engine has calculated the 32-bit hash value, it looks
to see if there exists a matching 32-bit value in the associated group of Hash
Records, in this example, group 0. If a matching 32-bit hash value is found, the
screen scraper engine returns the &#x003C;name&#x003E; of the Hash Record to the game state
engine.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30000.1.2"></a>Manipulating hash records using OpenScrape</h4>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Hash Records are created from specific Image records, so in order to create a Hash
record, you must first have collected the associated Image record (see section
{4.9}).
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   Figure 4.8-23 OpenScrape Create Hash Record buttons
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   The &#8220;Create Hash&#8221; buttons on the Table Map Editor window are used to create new
Hash records. Button &#8220;0&#8221; creates Hash records in the Hash0 group, button &#8220;1&#8221; creates
Hash records in the Hash1 group, and so on. These buttons are only available if an
Image record has been selected in the tree display on the Table Map Editor
window.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Note: Only one Hash record can exist in a Table Map in each hash group for any
given Image record. Otherwise, there would be collisions, and the screen scraper
engine would not know which Hash record was the correct match. In the &#8220;Create
Hash Record buttons&#8221; screenshot above, Hash records for group 0 and 2 have
already been created for the selected Image record, so those buttons are grayed
out.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   To create a new Hash records:
           <ol  class="enumerate1" >
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-3002x1">Select an Image record
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-3004x2">Click the &#8220;Create Hash&#8221; button for the hash group that you want to create
        this Hash record in.</li></ol>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The following window will then appear to confirm the addition of the new Hash
record:
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Figure 4.8-24 OpenScrape New Hash record confirmation
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   When you add a new Hash record with the &#8220;Create Hash&#8221; buttons, OpenScrape will
calculate the hash value for you and add it to the record. (This is new behavior in 2.0;
previous versions stored a zero hash value on new record creation) However, sometimes
you may need to change that stored hash value, if for example, you replace the
underlying Image record, or you change the number or location of the related Hash
Points. If one or more hash values need to be updated, use the &#8220;Update Hashes&#8221; option

on the Edit manu on the Main window, and the hash values on all Hash records will be
re-calculated. Technical Reference In the Table Map (.tm) file, these records
will be preceded with the characters "h$". Hash records have the following
format:
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   h&#x003C;n&#x003E;$&#x003C;name&#x003E; &#x003C;value&#x003E;
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   &#x003C;n&#x003E; is the group (1-3) that this hash record belongs to &#x003C;name&#x003E; is the string that is
returned to the scraper engine upon a match (the &#8220;result&#8221;) &#x003C;value&#x003E; is a 32bit
hexadecimal value that contains the calculated hash .
