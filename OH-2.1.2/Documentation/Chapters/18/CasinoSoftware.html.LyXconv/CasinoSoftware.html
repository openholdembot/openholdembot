<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >If the casino software demands admin privs to install/update/run, and if you&#8217;ve
successfully accomplished all 12 of these steps, then their software running as admin
cannot automatically read your stealth drive(s) / folder(s) - the contents are very much
private. However, if they are running as admin they could physically take ownership of
the folder in order to gain access.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   In this context, it must be said that such an event could be viewed as a criminal act
in that there is absolutely no need whatsoever for their software to decide to "take"
physical ownership of a folder just because it wants to.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   An advanced step (not covered in this article) is to install/enable file/folder
monitoring/auditing that will allow you to track anything that happens to your "safe"
folder. Note that doing this would not stop admin/casino software from taking
ownership but you&#8217;d have a record of the event which is better than nothing.
