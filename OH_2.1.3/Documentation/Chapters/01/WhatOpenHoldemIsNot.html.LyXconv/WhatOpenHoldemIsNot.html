<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem is not a complete poker bot. There is much work you need to do to
utilize the framework effectively, however this manual and the community
on the forums can help you to do so. If you truly desire a poker bot that
includes logic written by someone else, a quick Google search will turn up a
number of likely candidates. Be aware, however, that a pre-packaged, complete,
click-Setup.exe-and-go, poker bot is not a good way to be successful. Consistent and
trusted positive results from these pre-packaged bots are impossible to find. If
pre-packaged bots really worked, if we could have spent $20 to make $1000&#8217;s, we
certainly would have bought one ourselves, rather than spending the thousands of
hours to create this framework!
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   OpenHoldem does not allow for automated collusion. Poker botting currently is in
a gray area of legality and morality, with many strong perspectives on both sides of
the argument. The OpenHoldem development team strongly believes that automated
collusion is clearly illegal and immoral, and will not provide the facility to help you
achieve these ends.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   OpenHoldem is not a general-purpose poker botting engine for all styles of poker.
It is intentionally suited only to the "Texas Hold&#8217;em" flavor of poker favored my the
majority of online players today. Don&#8217;t ask if it supports Omaha - it doesn&#8217;t.
