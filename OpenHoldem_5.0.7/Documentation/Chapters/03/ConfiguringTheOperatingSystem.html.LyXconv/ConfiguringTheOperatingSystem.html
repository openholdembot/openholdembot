   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Configuring the operating system </h3>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem requires specific system settings in order to correctly intuit the game state
from the pixels on-screen, and to correctly take poker actions.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Color depth </h4>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >The display color depth must be set to 24-bit or 32-bit. Most Table Maps are designed
for 32-bit color depth, so your display should be set to that for maximum compatibility
with others&#8217; work.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Display resolution </h4>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >You need enough display resolution to contain both the poker client window and
OpenHoldem at it smallest size (i.e. table view off). In general, the minimum acceptable
display resolution is 1024x768. The smaller resolutions 800x600 and 640x480 do not have
enough real estate to show both the poker client and OpenHoldem without overlapping
windows.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Font smoothing </h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Font smoothing must be turned off in order to interpret font pixels correctly. Our
objective is to interpret the pixels as presented by the poker client, and not post-mangled
by the operating system. To disable font smoothing, right click the desktop,
and choose Properties&#8211;&#x003E;Appearance&#8211;&#x003E;Effects. Disable smoothed fonts in this
dialog.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Window style (themes)</h4>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >Windows 2000 only has one window style. There are no themes, there is no candy blue
coloring around windows, so you are OK if you use Windows 2000. With Windows XP, it
is suggested to use the &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme, which will present windows in the same style as
Windows 2000. You are of course free to use whatever theme you want, but be aware
that public Table Maps usually do not work unless they are used with the same theme
that they were designed for. Most OpenHoldem botters use Windows 2000 or the
Windows XP Classic theme.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Windows XP and ClearType </h4>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >If you use Windows XP, it is recommended that you disable ClearType fonts, for the same
reason that we suggest you disable font smoothing. Here is the link to the Microsoft web page
on how to do this: <a 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx " class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx</span></a>.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Language settings</h4>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Your language settings affect the behaviour of your system in several ways:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">how to display special characters
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">what to use as the decimal separator: dot or comma.</li></ul>

<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >This may seem to be nearly irrelevant, but can affect the scraper engine and the autoplayer
severly, even upto complete failure. The only settings, that are guaranteed to
work, are english ones. Others may or may not be compatible. If you are new to
botting, be smart and stay on the safe side; there have been more than enough
lengthy threads by desperate newbies, mostly caused by incorrect settings.
