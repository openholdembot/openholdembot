This is a guide to show you how to get OpenHoldem running securely on a
 single computer using the VMware Server application as a second, "virtual"
 computer.

\begin_layout Standard
The guide assumes no special knowledge, but you will need some basic computer
 skills.
 You will need to know how to install software, how to rename files, how
 to navigate folders and so on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am also assuming that you are using the same operating system as me.
 If you are using Windows XP Media Centre Edition or Windows XP Professional,
 you can use this guide.
 If you are using some other brand of Windows (including Vista), the guide
 might not be reliable.
 I have only tested these instructions with XP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of this information is already available elsewhere.
 In many cases, all I have done is to reword it a little.

Definitions

\begin_layout Standard
The "real" computer is the one that is sitting on your desk or on your lap.
 It has its own operating system.
 The "virtual" computer is the one we are going to create using VMware Server.
 We can think of the "virtual" computer as a separate computer with its
 own operating system, even though it is physically part of the "real" computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 1 - Download VMware Server 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VMware Server is a free download from 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.vmware.com
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You will need to provide VMware with a valid e-mail address to get a serial
 number.
 I used version 1.0.3 while writing this guide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will also need a Windows installation disk or an ISO-image of e.g.
 TinyXP.
 I am using a Windows XP Professional installation DVD, which I'm going
 to install as my "virtual" operating system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you wait for the download to finish, you should read the whole of
 this guide and make sure that you understand it.
 It would be a good idea to print it out, if you can.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Do not install any software
\emph default
 until you are told to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 2 - Install VMware Server on your real computer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Double-click on the VMware Server file you downloaded and it will begin
 installing itself.
 When you are asked if you want a "complete" or "custom" installation, choose
 "complete".
 A big window with some warnings about "IIS" might appear.
 We don't need IIS, so just click “OK”.
 When the installer asks for Internet access, grant it.
 Wait for the installation to complete before moving on to the next step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 3 - Configure VMware Player 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Double-click on the "VMware Server" icon that should have appeared on the
 desktop of your real computer.
 VMware Server will start for the first time.
 A Pop-up window asks you to choose between a local host and a remote host.
 Choose "local host" and click "OK".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click the "New Virtual Machine" icon and a window will appear.
 Choose "typical" and click "next".
 Now choose which operating system you want to install on your virtual computer.
 Here, I selected the "Microsoft Windows" option, and the version I selected
 was "Windows XP, Professional".
 if you want to install from a CD-image and not from a real CD then just
 point VMware to the location of the ISO-image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next window gives you two boxes to fill in.
 The first box gives you a chance to name your new virtual computer.
 Choose any name you like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second box ("Location") allows you to choose where the Virtual computer
 will be saved on your hard drive.
 You probably don't need to change the contents of this box.
 (The virtual computer is actually a single file which exists on the hard
 drive of your real computer.
 If you want this file to be in a different folder or even on a different
 partition, you can tell VMware now.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next you must choose the type of 
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
network
\end_layout

\end_inset

network.
 Choose "Use bridged networking".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next window asks you to decide how big the virtual computer's virtual
 hard drive is going to be.
 The suggested 8GB is quite enough for the purposes of playing poker.
 Click "Finish" when you are ready.
 Some operating-systems like Windows 2000 or TinyXP will be satisfied with
 a bit less disk space, but don't forget that you also need space for casino-sof
tware, hand-histories and maybe PokerTracker.
 Better safe than sorry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VMware will thereafter spend quite a few minutes creating the virtual computer.
 Wait until the installation is complete.
 You should be looking at a brand-new installation of Windows XP.
 If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire")
 then you are ready to move on to the next step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 4 - Install an 
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
operating system
\end_layout

\end_inset

operating system on the virtual computer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When VMware is ready, you'll see a new window with some details about the
 virtual computer.
 Find "Start this virtual machine" on the left and click it.
 VMware will now look for the Windows installation disk in your CD/DVD drive.
 Put the installation disk in the drive and Windows will begin installing
 onto your virtual computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon, Windows will ask you if you want to format your hard drive.
 Only the virtual hard drive of the virtual computer is going to get formatted,
 so you don't need to worry about the data on your real hard drive.
 It is perfectly safe.
 If you asked how you want to format the virtual hard drive, make sure you
 choose one of the NTFS options.
 (Do not choose any option with FAT16 or FAT32).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually, Windows will ask you to enter your full name.
 We are going to create three seperate users, so choose a name for the first
 user ("Jessica", for example) and enter it here.
 This user will have permanent administrator privileges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, enter an administrator password for this user.
 Write down the name and password now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Administrator name and password
\emph default
 _________________________ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later, Windows will ask you to enter up to five user names.
 The first user - the box labelled "your name" - should be the same as the
 user you entered above ("Jessica").
 Don't fill in the other boxes yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wait until the installation is complete.
 You should be looking at a brand-new installation of Windows XP.
 If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire")
 then you are ready to move on to the next step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 5 - Install VMTools,

\end_layout

\end_inset

Antivirus on virtual computer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VMTools is a package which, among other things, gets the mouse to move smoothly
 between the real and the virtual computer.
 You need to install it now, so press CTRL+ALT to restore mouse control
 to the real computer.
 Then, on the VMware Server window, click on the menu option VM, and then
 choose "Install VMTools..." VMTools will now install itself inside the virtual
 computer.
 The virtual computer will need to reboot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the reboot, find the VMTools icon in the system tray, next to the
 clock.
 It looks like three small interlinked squares.
 When you have found it, double-click on it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A window appears and the "Options" tab is already showing.
 Find the line "Show VMware Tools in the taskbar" and click on it, so that
 there is no longer a tick next to it.
 Click “OK” to save your changes.
 This measure prevents the casino from seeing that you're using VMware -
 just in case they take a screenshot of your desktop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, your virtual computer is connected to the Internet, so it needs firewall
 software and antivirus software, just as your real computer does.
 Install the software (connect to the Internet to download it, if you have
 to), and then run a scan to check that your virtual computer is free from
 viruses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(You could use AVG Antivirus (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://free.grisoft.com
\end_layout

\end_inset

), and Zonealarm Firewall (
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.zonealarm.com
\end_layout

\end_inset

)) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 6 - Check that the real and virtual computers can communicate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the real computer and the virtual computer can't communicate with each
 other, all your efforts in securing them will be wasted.
 Let's check the communications now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional way to test a network is to have one computer "ping" the
 other.
 A ping is a short signal which one computer sends to another.
 The signal will get bounced back if the network is running as it should.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before pinging anything, you need to turn off the firewalls on both computers.
 If you have installed a firewall such as Zonealarm, switch it off.
 Now click "Start - Control Panel - Security Centre".
 At the bottom of the window is an option to "Manage security settings for:
 Windows Firewall".
 Click on "Windows Firewall" and make sure it is off.
 Do this on both computers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you need to find out the IP address for both computers.
 (An IP address is a numerical address which computers on a network use
 to identify each other.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On your real computer, click "Start - Run".
 Type "cmd" in the box and press return.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new window appears.
 Type “ipconfig" and press return.
 You will see a series of numbers, some of which are marked "IP address".
 Find the one that corresponds to the type of Internet connection you have
 - for example, the one labeled "wireless connection" if you connect to
 the Internet through a wireless router.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The IP address of my real computer is 192.168.1.4 - yours probably looks almost
 the same.
 Write it down now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Real computer IP address
\emph default
_________________________ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now do the same thing on your virtual computer.
 Find the IP address and write it down.
 The IP address of my virtual computer is 192.168.1.7 - yours will be similar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Virtual computer IP address
\emph default
 _________________________ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On your real computer, find the new window again and type "ping x.x.x.x", then
 press return.
 Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of your virtual computer.
 You should see something like this...

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to your virtual computer and do the same thing.
 This time, type "ping x.x.x.x" replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address of your
 real computer.
 If you get a response, your network is set up properly and you can continue
 to the next step.
 If the network isn't set up properly, you should seek help from someone
 who understands networks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't forget to 
\emph on
turn your firewalls back on again
\emph default
 when you finish this step.
 If you have a good firewall such as Zonealarm, you can leave the less powerful
 Windows firewall turned off permanently (on your real computer as well
 as your virtual computer).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 7 - Set up user accounts on virtual computer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click "Start - Control Panel - User Accounts".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You had already set up one user while installing Windows.
 This user already has admin privileges.
 We'll call it the "admin" user.
 We need to give this user a password.
 It can be the same password you used in step 4.
 Click on the user, then click on "create a password".
 Enter the password into the boxes and click on "create password".
 The next window asks you if you want to make your files and folders private.
 You certainly do, so click "Yes, make private".
 Click on "Back" to return to the user accounts window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we'll set up two new users with fewer privileges.
 You will be logged in as the second user whenever you connect to a casino.
 We'll call this the "casino" user.
 The third user will be created to hide things from the casino.
 We'll call this the "stealth" user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose names and passwords for these users, and write them all down now.

 Click on "limited" and then click on "create account".
 The casino user will appear next to the admin user.
 Click on the casino user and give it a password.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stealth user will have restricted privileges permanently.
 Click "create a new account" and set up the stealth user in the same way
 you set up the casino user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click "create a new account".
 Choose a name and then click on "limited account".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That completes this step.
 If there is a "guest" user shown, you can ignore it.
 Close the "user accounts" window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 8 - Create a protected folder on virtual computer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should still be logged in as the admin user.
 Stay logged in as this user throughout step 8.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to create a folder to hide some sensitive information.
 The best place for this folder is inside the root folder (click Start -
 My Computer - Local Disk C:.
 Then click on "show contents of this folder").
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a new folder in this window and give it an innocent name.
 ("Files" would be a good name.) From now on, this folder will be referred
 to as the "Ninja" folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click "Start - Control Panel - (Appearances and Themes) - Folder Options".
 Click the "View" tab.
 In the "Advanced Settings" window, find the line "Use simple file sharing
 (recommended)".
 If there is a green tick on this line, click on it to remove it.
 Click on the big "OK" button to save your changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, right click on the Ninja folder and choose "Properties".
 Click on the "Security" tab.
 In the "Group or user names" box you will see a list of users, but the
 stealth user should not be one of them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want to change the folder's settings so that the stealth user is the
 only user who can see inside it.
 (Not even users with admin privileges should be able to see inside.) Click
 the “Add" button.
 In the "Enter the object names to select" box, type in the name of the
 stealth user (for example, my stealth user is called James).
 Click the "OK" button.
 There should now be a new entry in the list.
 My stealth user shows up as “James (XPPRO/James)" in that list.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we need to remove every user except the stealth user from the list.
 Click the "Advanced" button.
 Find the line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." and
 click on it.
 A warning pop-up appears; click on the "Remove" button.
 The line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." should
 no longer have a tick next to it.
 Click the “OK” button.
 Another warning pop-up might appear.
 If it does, click "Remove", then “OK”.
 The list of users should now have only one user in it, the stealth user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Find the "Full control" line.
 In the "allow" column, there is a small box.
 Click on it, and a column full of ticks will appear.
 If everything has gone to plan, there will be one user with full control
 over the Ninja folder.
 If you're happy, click "OK".
 If something seems to be wrong, click "Cancel" and go through the last
 two paragraphs again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 9 - Take charge of the protected folder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log out from the admin user account and login as the stealth user (click
 Start - Log off - Switch User).
 Go to "My Computer" again and find the Ninja folder.
 Right click on the folder and choose "Properties".
 Click on the "Security" tab.
 Check that the stealth user is still the only user in the list.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click the "Advanced" button and click the "Owner" tab.
 Left click once on the stealth user so that it changes colour to blue.
 Find the "Replace owner..." line and click on it, so that a green tick appears
 next to it.
 Then click on "Apply".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user in the box "Current owner of this item" should have changed to
 the stealth user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now click on the "Permissions" tab.
 Find the "Inherit from the parent permission entries..." line; there should
 still be no tick next to it.
 Just below, find the "Replace permission entries on all child objects..."
 line; click on it so that there is a green tick next to it.
 Click the "Apply" button.
 A warning pop-up appears; click the "Yes" button.
 Click on the “OK” buttons twice to save your changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's check that everything is set up correctly.
 The stealth user is the only one who should be able to see the Ninja folder
 and 
\emph on
anything
\emph default
 it contains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open the Ninja folder (by double clicking on it) and create a folder called
 "test" inside it.
 Right click on the "test" folder, choose "Properties" and click on the
 "Security" tab.
 If the stealth user is the only person in the list, everything is as it
 should be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close all the windows and log out from the stealth user account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 10 - One more check 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log in as the admin user.
 Find the Ninja folder, and try to look inside it.
 Your attempt to see inside this protected folder should be denied.
 When you run casino software, it will not be able to see inside this folder
 (unless it tries to take ownership of the folder - but this would be a
 
\emph on
criminal
\emph default

Step 11 - Install

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Bring
\end_layout

\end_inset

Bring on your virtual computer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You now have a real computer and a virtual computer.
 OpenHoldem is going to run on the real computer.
 The casino software is going to run on the virtual computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you need to install some software that will allow OpenHoldem (on the
 real computer) to see what the casino software (on the virtual computer)
 is doing.
 There are several ways of doing this.
 We are going to use a piece of software called "Bring".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the virtual computer, log in as the stealth user.
 Now go to the official WinHoldem site (See {Bring}) and download "bring.exe"
 (from the "stealth" page).
 Download it directly into the Ninja folder:

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The casino software can't see inside the Ninja folder, but it will be able
 to see Bring being run as a process.
 (If you want to see all the processes your computer is running, press CTRL+ALT+
DEL and then click on the "processes" tab.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution is to rename Bring to something more innocent.
 Then, if the casino software looks at the processes you are running, it
 won't be able to find out anything incriminating about Bring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rename Bring now.
 For example, you could rename it to "notepad" or “paint".

\begin_layout Standard
You can now install Bring on your real computer.
 You don't need to rename it; the casino cannot see what is happening on
 your real computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a folder on the desktop, call it "Bring", and download into it the
 files "bring.exe" and “bring.ini".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click "Start - Control Panel - Folder Options".
 Click the "View" tab.
 In the box labeled "Advanced Settings", scroll down and find the line "Hide
 extensions for known file types".
 If there is a green tick next to this line, click on it to make the tick
 disappear.
 Click "OK” to save your changes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should also install OpenHoldem on your real computer now if you haven't
 already.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On your real computer, go into the "Bring" folder you just created and open
 the file "bring.ini" in a text editor.
 (Right-click on “bring.ini”, choose "Open with..." and select "Notepad".)

eeee is the "port" number.
 It can be a number of your own choice.
 80 would be a good choice, and so would 800, 5000 or 8080.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
"secret" is a password.
 It's not a good password, but it is fine for the purposes of testing Bring.

Step 14 - Start Bring 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we're going to test Bring by playing a game of solitaire on the virtual
 computer, and by attempting to control it from the real computer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to the virtual computer.
 You should still be logged in as the stealth user.
 Start the Solitaire programme ("Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire").
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now open another command prompt (click "Start - Run", type "cmd" and press
 enter).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command prompt window is currently looking at the "My Documents" folder.
 You need to move into the Ninja folder.
 If you followed the earlier suggestion, the location of your Ninja folder
 will be "C:
\backslash
files".
 To move into this folder, simply type “CD C:
\backslash
files" and press return.
 (If this doesn't work you will need to learn how to use the command prompt.
 Do an Internet search for "DOS command prompt".) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now type the following command and press return.
 Instead of bring, you should type the name of your renamed file.
 Instead of 80, you should type the port number you chose in the previous
 step, and instead of "secret" you should type the password you chose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small pop-up will appear to show you that Bring has started on your virtual
 computer.
 Click "OK".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now go to your real computer.
 Go into the Bring folder and double click on "bring.exe".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another pop-up appears to show you that Bring has started on your real computer.
 Click “OK”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another window appears labeled "Select remote connection".
 You should see a line that looks exactly like the line you entered in the
 "bring.ini" file.

\begin_layout Standard
Click on this line so that it turns blue, and click the "OK" button.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another window appears with a list of programs that are currently running
 on your virtual computer.
 One of them should be solitaire, so click on it so that it turns blue and
 then click the "OK" button.
 Solitaire will launch on your real computer, and if everything is set up
 correctly, you will be able to play it and watch your mouse clicks affecting
 both computers at once! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are unable to control solitaire from your real computer you definitely
 won't be able to control a poker table.
 Before you continue, seek help from someone who understands networks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 15 - Stop running Bring 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have had enough of playing solitaire, you should shut down Bring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the real computer, just close the solitaire window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the virtual computer, there are three ways to stop Bring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Log off 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stop the Bring process.
 Press CTRL+ALT+DEL.
 Two task manager windows will appear, one for the real computer and one
 for the virtual computer.
 Find the task manager on the virtual computer and click the "Processes"
 tab, find “bring.exe" (however you renamed it), click on it to turn it blue,
 and then click on "End Process".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lock the desktop.
 This doesn't actually close Bring, but it does halt it and prevent your
 real computer from communicating with it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stop Bring on both computers before you move on to the next step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 16 - Set up the "run as a different user" facility 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you connect to the casino's Internet site you should always be logged
 into your virtual computer as the casino user.
 However, you will be running Bring 
\emph on
as if
\emph default
 you will logged on as the stealth user.
 In this way, the casino won't be able to detect that you are using Bring.
 Here's how to do it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user.
 Right-click on the desktop and choose "New", then choose "Shortcut".
 A window will appear.
 In the box, type "cmd".
 Click "Next" and then click "Finish".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new icon, “cmd.exe", will have appeared on your desktop.
 It's actually a shortcut to the command prompt that you have used a few
 times before.
 Right-click on this shortcut and choose "Properties".
 A window appears and the "Shortcut" tab should already be showing.
 Click the "Advanced" button.
 Find the line which reads "Run with different credentials".
 Click on it so that a tick appears next to it.
 Click the "OK" buttons twice.
 "Run with different credentials" actually means "run this program as a
 different user".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start solitaire again.
 Double click the “cmd.exe" shortcut and a window will appear, asking you
 which user you want to use to run the program.
 Click on the line "The following user".
 Then, enter the stealth user's name and password, and click “OK".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command prompt window appears.
 It is running as if you were logged in as the stealth user.
 We can safely run Bring from this window.
 Go into the Ninja folder (perhaps by typing "CD C:
\backslash
files”).
 Type the following command, changing the words "bring", "80" and "secret"
 exactly as you did in step 14.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

bring -s 80 secret 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bring's pop-up window appears, so click the “OK” button.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now go to the real computer and start Bring there.
 Try to open the solitaire window, just as you did before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go back to the virtual computer.
 Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to make the task manager appear in both windows.
 Find the virtual computer's task manager and select the "Properties" tab.
 Check that "bring.exe" (however you renamed it) is running under the stealth
 user, even though you are logged in as the casino user.
 Check that "sol.exe" - the solitaire process - is running under the casino
 user.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still on the virtual computer and still logged in as the casino user, go
 to the WinHoldem site.
 There should be two files - "gaze.cpp" and “gaze.exe".
 Download both of them to the virtual computer's desktop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Double click on “gaze.exe” to run it.
 A window will appear, and shortly afterwards a pop-up labeled "Windows
 - no disk" will appear.
 Click the "Cancel" button, and close the Gaze window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the test have been saved to a file on the desktop called
 "gaze”.
 Confusingly, there are now two text files on the desktop with the same
 name.
 Double click one of them to open it in a text editor.
 If the first few lines don't look like this, you've got the wrong file.

 On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user.
 Create a new folder on the desktop called "poker".
 It's a good idea to install all your casino software in a single folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The casino user currently has restricted privileges.
 Some casinos insist that you install their software when logged in as a

 Some casinos also insist that you run their software when logged in as

 Preferably, we would like to install and run the software while logged
 in as a user has restricted privileges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is how to set up a typical casino's poker software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still logged in as the casino user, go to the casino web site.
 Download their software directly into the poker folder you created moments
 ago.
 Go into the folder and double click on the software.
 It will begin installing.
 When the install asks where you would like to install the software, choose
 the "poker" folder you created moments ago.
 Don't let the install the use the default folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the installation completes without complaints, all is well.
 However, if the installation complaints that it needs administrative privileges
, this is what you must do: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Log out from the casino user's account and log in to the admin user's account.
 Open the "User Accounts" window just as you did before.
 Click on the casino user act and then click on "Change the account type".
 Click on "Computer Administrator" and then click the "Change Account Type"
 button.
 Log out from the admin user's account and log back into the casino user's
 account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Try to install the software again.
 This time it should install without complaints.
 Now log out of the casino user's account and go back to the admin user
 account.
 Change the casino user's account type back to "limited".
 Log out of the admin user account and log back into the casino user's account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now try running the software.
 If the software complaints that it needs administrative privileges to run,
 change the casino user's account to "Computer Administrator" just as you
 did above.
 It's unfortunate that you have to run the software with administrative
 privileges, but it's not the end of the world.
