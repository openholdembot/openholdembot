</h2>
<ol>
<li>
IPoker, Bovada/Bodog, 888: supported by Shanky Bonusbots. Lots of people botting there naked without any stealth and insane &ldquo;human-like&rdquo; hours.
</li>
<li>
Cereus (former Absolute and Ultimate): the scandal casino with the worst reputation on earth. Bots welcome.
</li>
<li>
OnGame: we once knew a guy who ran a farm there, 55 acounts, NL 10 SSS, singletabling (because his hopper was not able to run more than one table), playing all accounts naked round the clock. It took six weeks until he got busted.
</li>
<li>
Winning Network: no bans known
</li>
<li>
Prima Network: the only ban we ever heard of happened after a long holiday (bot turned off).
</li>
<li>
MicroGaming: occasional bans
</li>
<li>
CakePoker: supported by Shanky and bot-friendly. Disallows PokerTracker support to protect both fish and bots. However they ban OpenHoldem botters who play naked, maybe because these bots are fewer and more sophisticated.
</li>
<li>
Merge: supported by Shanky in the past until a mass-ban out of the blue sky.
</li>
<li>
Supposed to be nearly as strict as PokerStars back in 2006 when Party got 70% of the Poker market. However reports about bans became very rare in the mean-time and more and more people report good successes.

FullTilt:
