If the casino software demands admin privs to install/update/run, and if you’ve successfully accomplished all 12 of these steps, then their software running as admin cannot automatically read your stealth drive(s) / folder(s) - the contents are very much private. However, if they are running as admin they could physically take ownership of the folder in order to gain access.

<div class="Indented">
In this context, it must be said that such an event could be viewed as a criminal act in that there is absolutely no need whatsoever for their software to decide to "take" physical ownership of a folder just because it wants to. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
An advanced step (not covered in this article) is to install/enable file/folder monitoring/auditing that will allow you to track anything that happens to your "safe" folder. Note that doing this would not stop admin/casino software from taking ownership but you’d have a record of the event which is better than nothing.
