           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">The set of symbols got extended over time - not all of them are available
        for all versions of OpenHoldem. This list reflects the latest version of
        OpenHoldem.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Not  all  symbols  are  equally  reliable.  Some  symbols  do  rely  only  on
        the  current  state  (e.g.  stacks  and  bets),  some  require  the  complete
        game-history  (e.g.  nbetsroundX).  All  symbols  which  rely  on  history
        are  especially  volatile  against  (incorrect)  hand-resets  and  temporary
        occlusion. That is no bug, but simply inevitable. It is the users duty to
        care about a stable environment.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Autoplayer-symbols (e.g. didcallroundX) mean: what the autoplayer did,
        not what happened in the game. If you connect in the middle of the game,
        if you interact manually or if you connect multiple bots to the same table,
        then these symbols will return unexpected results. It may also sometimes
        (very rarely) happen, that the autoplayer attempts to act, but that the
        action fails for whatever reason and has no effect. If you need failsafe
        code, you should check a combination of various symbols (e.g. bets and
        balances).
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Some symbols like nplayersdealt have been very sensitive to fast folds in
        early position, as there&#8217;s no guarantee, that we catch every single state and
        every single event. The &#8220;obvious&#8221; workaround was to use nchairsdeltleft
        and nchairsdealtright to determine the position relative to the dealer. But
        as too many newbies have been overburdened by such subtleties we do
        now consider players as &#8220;dealt&#8221;, when they are posting blinds. This is may
        very rarely give incorrect results, but is far better than the old approach.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Detecting blinds correctly from screenshots is a nearly impossible task,
        if you want to consider all possible cases (missing small blind; additional
        blinds;  players  posting  blinds  +  dead;  distinguishing  blinds  in  early
        position from open-limpers; players sitting in again without having to post
        a blind and limping; players being allin for the blind or less; reversed
        blinds for most heads-up games; 3-handed-games becoming headsup; etc.).
        Therefore  OH  does  mostly  assume,  that  there  are  exactly  two  blinds
        present in the game.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">If there are multiple ways to make the same hand (e.g. KT on a board of
        9TJQ2) OpenHoldem will first use your hole-cards, then the board-cards.
        In the example above it will use both cards for the straight (npcbits = 2),
        though one of the cards is on the board, too. Both ways have its pros and
        cons, but this one is backward compatible to WinHoldem.</li></ul>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >Whenever there are unclear questions regarding some symbols, ManualMode and the
debug-tab will give you quick answers in a reliable and reproducable way. If
you have further questions or if the results at ManualMode seem to be wrong,
feel free to ask at the forums and provide some screenshots for explanantion.
