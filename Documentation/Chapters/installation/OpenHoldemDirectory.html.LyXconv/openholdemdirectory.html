<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >In this directory are the following files:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">ManualMode.exe,   OHReplay.exe,   OpenHoldem.exe,   OpenScrape.exe,
        Rebuy.exe &#8212; these are the main files for each of the programs in the
        OpenHoldem project. Details on how to use each of these are throughout
        this manual.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">dbghelp.dll &#8212; this is a Microsoft file that is used to produce memory
        dumps  on  critical  errors.  These  memory  dumps  are  useful  for  the
        developers to diagnose issues.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">keyboard.dll,  mouse.dll,  perl_callback.dll,  scraper.dll,  user.dll  &#8212;  these
        files are all extensions to OpenHoldem that you can use to customize the
        software. More detail on all of these are provided in this document.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">*.lib-files &#8211; these are linker files, necessary to link executables and DLLs
        against each other.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">versus.bin &#8212; this file is a large lookup table that is mandatory for the
        versus symbols. As the versus database is quite large and does not change
        it is not included in the archives with recent executables. It is available
        as a separate download at google-code and should be extracted to the
        OpenHoldem directory.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Files with .pdb extensions &#8212; these files contain the debug symbols that
        are required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution in
        a debugger. If you need these, you know how to use these. If you don&#8217;t
        know what these are, you can safely ignore or delete them.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">A  file  with  .ini  extensions  &#8212;  this  is  the  configuration  file  with  your
        preferred  settings;  OpenHoldem  won&#8217;t  store  any  information  in  the
        registry but use a ini-file instead; it can be named whatever you like,
        OpenHoldem will use it automatically, as long as there is only one ini-file
        in the directory.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">OpenHoldem_Manual.chm &#8212; this manual.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Documents-directory &#8211; this directory contains useful information like the
        release-notes that document changes and the license-information (GPL
        v3). Feel free to peruse these if you have problems falling asleep some
        night.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Logs &#8211; this directory contains the log-files of the OpenHoldem bots. The
        logs are named &#8220;oh_0.log&#8221; .. &#8220;oh_24.log&#8221;. The log-files provide very useful
        information if you want to track down mis-plays or even bugs. To get the

        correct file for a certain instance of OpenHoldem you can also use &#8220;Menu
        -&#x003E; Edit -&#x003E; View Log File&#8221; and OpenHoldem will open a text-editor with
        the correct log.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Scraper  &#8211;  this  directory  contains  the  tablemaps  for  your  favourite
        casinos. Just add your new tablemaps there once they have been tested;
        OpenHoldem will then load these tablemaps, so that its auto-connector
        will be able to connect out-of-the box to any open table and start playing.</li></ul>
