versus.bin
\end_layout

\end_inset

versus.bin --- this file is a large lookup table that is mandatory for the
 versus symbols.
 As the versus database is quite large and does not change it is not included
 in the archives with recent executables.
 It is available as a separate download at google-code and should be extracted
 to the OpenHoldem directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .pdb extensions --- these files contain the debug symbols that
 are required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution
 in a debugger.
 If you need these, you know how to use these.
 If you donâ€™t know what these are, you can safely ignore or delete them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .txt extensions --- these are the release notes for each of the
 programs in the project.
 Feel free to peruse these if you have problems falling asleep some night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .ini extensions --- these are configuration files; they can be
 used for easy deployment on new machines or to avoid traces in the registry.
