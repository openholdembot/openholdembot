</h2>

OpenHoldem and its supporting applications do not come with an installer. This is by design – installers tend to leave traces on your system, and in this hobby, the less traces, the better. Stealth will be discussed in greater depth in a later section, but this installer-less install is an important part of the stealth strategy.

Since you do not have an installer to do the work for you, there are several steps you need to take to correctly configure the software on your machine:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Create your “OpenHoldem” base directory. For purposes of this walkthrough, we will create this directory as “c:\mpb” (“My Poker Bot” – clever, eh?). You can make this directory anything you want, however
</li>
<li>
Under c:\mpb, create another directory “c:\mpb\scraper”; this directory is used by the “Green Circle Button” to automagically connect OpenHoldem to a poker table. More on this later. There is a non-automagic way to connect to tables, but at this point, you probably want this directory. 
</li>
<li>
Download the compiled binary packages. They can be found at the links in the {References} section
</li>
<li>
Extract all the files from the compiled binary packages into the c:\mpb directory. When done, your directory should look something like this, depending of course, on which programs you chose to extract.<div class="float">
