The “scraper” directory should be where your Table Map files are stored. Table maps provide the OpenHoldem game state engine the instructions for deriving the state of the game from the pixels on the screen. These files have the “.tm” extension on them. The challenge with table maps is that every casino needs its own map. In some cases, you might need different maps for different game flavors. NL vs. FL, SNG vs. Ring, 10-seat vs. Heads-Up, for example.

The OpenHoldem project team does not provide official Table Maps for any casino or any Texas Hold’em game flavor. The reason for this is that there are thousands of casinos out there, and tens- or hundreds- of thousands of map combinations when you consider the different game flavors. Adding to that is the fact that casinos regularly update their client software and make minor or comprehensive changes to the pixels as they are displayed on the screen. These changes most often require changes to the table map as well. The OpenHoldem Project development team is a group of volunteers — we do not get paid for this, we have real lives and real families, and do this as a hobby. Maintaining working Table Maps would be a more than full time job, and thus instead we put the power in your hands; we provide Table Map creation tools and testing tools to allow you to be self-sufficient. An explanation of the “OpenScrape” program, which is key to this self-sufficiency, will be provided in more detail later in this document.

That said, there are a number of places you can find pre-created maps for use with OpenHoldem. There is a section on our forums !!!! (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=Table_Maps">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=Table_Maps</a>) that contains user-contributed maps. These maps are likely to be more or less out of date, and would require some validation to ensure they are 100% correct. Consider these maps to be a starting point for learning how maps are constructed and how they work. The forums have a lot of discussion on maps, and you can likely find maps attached to posts; same caveats apply as to the Wiki maps.

Helping can be a bit tough if you have to ask all day for missing information.
