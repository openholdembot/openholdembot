Poker Tracker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poker Tracker preferences control how OpenHoldem interacts with a Poker
 Tracker database.
 See the {PokerTracker} section for more information on using Poker Tracker
 with OpenHoldem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Disable all Poker Tracker access
\emph default
: Checking this preference will completely disable all Poker Tracker functionali
ty in OpenHoldem.
 If you make no use of any Poker Tracker symbols, then it is safe to check
 this box.
 
\end_layout

 This setting will instruct OpenHoldem as to which flavor of Poker Tracker
 you are using.

 Enter them here so OpenHoldem knows how to connect to your database.

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Update delay
\emph default
: OpenHoldem maintains an internal cache of Poker Tracker statistics that
 it periodically queries from the Poker Tracker database.
 This setting determines the frequency that OpenHoldem will use (in seconds)
 to consider re-querying those statistics.
 This setting is akin to the “Scrape Delay” setting in the Scraper preferences
 for the screen scraper engine.
 This parameter does not need to be a particularly small value, as the informati
on in Poker Tracker does not change that often itself.
 Note: Just because this delay has expired, and the Poker Tracker query
 engine “wakes up”, does not guarantee that every statistic will be updated.
 Rather, this works in conjunction with the “Cache refresh” parameter below
 to decide if a statistic needs updating or not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Cache refresh
\emph default
: After the Poker Tracker query engine has been “woken up”, because the
 delay specified in the “Update delay” parameter has expired, the engine
 will scan through each of its statistics for every chair and determine
 if that statistic needs updating or not.
 If the duration between now and the last time that a given statistic was
 retrieved from Poker Tracker is greater than this parameter (in seconds),
 then the engine considers the statistic to be stale and will query Poker
 Tracker for a new value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Test
\emph default
: This button will test the connection to the Poker Tracker database as
 specified by the above parameters and will report success or failure codes.
