class="ecti-1000">Manual choice: </span>The default classical method. If exactly one table and
            exactly one matching tablemap exist OpenHoldem will connect to
            that table directly, otherwise it will present a dialog with a list of
            choices for manual selection. This behaviour was quite inconvenient
            in production, but is still supported for backward compatibility.
            </li>
            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Automatical choice: </span>This option will pick the first available table on
            every attempt to connect, that is not yet attached to another instance
            of OpenHoldem. If no such table is available, it will fall silently. If
            multiple tablemaps in the scraper-folder fit to that table it will also
            pick the &#8220;first&#8221; one, so be careful, if you want to keep different versions
            of the same map.</li></ul>

            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Never: </span>The default classical method. If exactly one table and exactly
            one matching tablemap exist OpenHoldem will connect to that table
            directly,  otherwise  it  will  present  a  dialog  with  a  list  of  choices
            for  manual  selection.  This  behaviour  was  quite  inconvenient  in
            production, but is still supported for backward compatibility.
            </li>
            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Once on start: </span>This option will cause OpenHoldem to auto-connect
            exactly once on start. This setting is especially useful in combination
            with the option to automatically choose a table. If no table exists,
            that fits to a tablemap &#8212; or if all such tables are already getting
            served &#8212; , it will fail silently and behave the default way, waiting for
            the green button or a connection-message.
            </li>
            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Permanent</span><span 
class="eccc-1000">:  </span>This   setting   will   cause   OpenHoldem   to   try   to
            auto-connect   once   every   N   seconds.   After   some   refactoring
            OpenHoldem does now cache the connection-data of all known table
            maps and all instances of OpenHoldem are now synchronized. If one
            instance fails to connect, the other ones will be blocked for the next N
            seconds. So the system-load is now astonishing low, even with dozens
            of instances waiting for tables.</li></ul>
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Close OH when table disappears: </span>This option will terminate OpenHoldem, when
        the poker table stops to exist, e.g. when the table got closed by the hopper or

        when you get moved to another table in a MTT. This method is for you, if your
        philosophy to do reconnects is to close OpenHoldem and to simply fire up
        another instance or if you want to easily shut your botting system down at the
        end of a session.</li></ul>
