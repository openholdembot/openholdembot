<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Logging preferences control what information OpenHoldem will periodically write to
various log files.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Enable Log Symbols</span>: If this setting is checked, any log$ symbols that are
        encountered in your OH-Script will be added to OpenHoldem&#8217;s log file.
        Everytime a log$ symbol is accessed it will be flagged for logging. You
        can use this to track which part of your formula is responsible for the
        action taken by OpenHoldem. You want to use the log$ symbol at the end
        of a logic block, to make sure it only gets flagged when all the previous
        statements are true.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Maximum symbols</span>:  This  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  &#8220;Enable  Log
        Symbols&#8221; preference, and specifies the maximum number of log$ symbols
        that will be logged per action. When &#8220;Enable Log Symbols&#8221; enabled, up
        to four log$ symbols will be displayed in OpenHoldem&#8217;s main window in
        the center information box.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Enable Autoplayer Trace</span>: This setting will enable tracing to the log file of
        the Autoplayer&#8217;s evaluation process. The primary functions that are traced
        are selected in the listbox control directly below. See the {Autoplayer
        Trace} sub-section in the {Validator} section for more information.!!!???
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Disable   all   runtime   MessageBoxes</span>:   This   preference   will   prevent
        OpenHoldem from displaying warning and error message boxes during
        runtime   (when   OpenHoldem   is   connected   to   a   table).   This   is
        extraordinarily dangerous and should only be used when you have a 100%
        stable bot that you want to move to a fully automated execution model.
        It is strongly advised that you do not check this option until you have a
        very stable and thoroughly tested botting environment.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Debug output level</span>: This will control the verbosity of the output written
        to the log files. Zero will disable all logging, and 3 is the highest level of
        logging. At the time of this writing, detailed level-3 logging is available for
        critical parts of OpenHoldem, including the heartbeat thread, the Screen
        Scraper engine, the Autoplayer engine and the Rebuy management.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Poker Tracker debug output level</span>: This will control the verbosity of the
        output written to the Poker Tracker log files. Zero will disable all logging,
        and 3 is the highest level of logging.</li></ul>
