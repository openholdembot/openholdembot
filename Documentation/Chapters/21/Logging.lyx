Logging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logging preferences control what information OpenHoldem will periodically
 write to various log files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Enable Log Symbols
\emph default
: If this setting is checked, any log$ symbols that are encountered in your
 OH-Script will be added to OpenHoldem’s log file.
 Everytime a log$ symbol is accessed it will be flagged for logging.
 You can use this to track which part of your formula is responsible for
 the action taken by OpenHoldem.
 You want to use the log$ symbol at the end of a logic block, to make sure
 it only gets flagged when all the previous statements are true.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Maximum symbols
\emph default
: This is used in conjunction with the “Enable Log Symbols” preference,
 and specifies the maximum number of log$ symbols that will be logged per
 action.
 When “Enable Log Symbols” enabled, up to four log$ symbols will be displayed
 in OpenHoldem's main window in the center information box.

Autoplayer Trace
\end_layout

\end_inset

Autoplayer Trace
\emph default
: This setting will enable tracing to the log file of the Autoplayer’s evaluatio
n process.
 The primary functions that are traced are selected in the listbox control
 directly below.
 See the {Autoplayer Trace} sub-section in the {Validator} section for more
 information.!!!??? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Disable all runtime MessageBoxes
\emph default
: This preference will prevent OpenHoldem from displaying warning and error
 message boxes during runtime (when OpenHoldem is connected to a table).
 This is extraordinarily dangerous and should only be used when you have
 a 100% stable bot that you want to move to a fully automated execution
 model.
 It is strongly advised that you do not check this option until you have
 a very stable and thoroughly tested botting environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Debug output level
\emph default
: This will control the verbosity of the output written to the log files.
 Zero will disable all logging, and 3 is the highest level of logging.
 At the time of this writing, detailed level-3 logging is available for
 critical parts of OpenHoldem, including the heartbeat thread, the Screen
 Scraper engine, the Autoplayer engine and the Rebuy management.

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Poker Tracker debug output level
\emph default
: This will control the verbosity of the output written to the Poker Tracker
 log files.
 Zero will disable all logging, and 3 is the highest level of logging.
