Validator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Validator preferences control various aspects of OpenHoldem’s Validator
 engine.
 See the {Validator} section for more information.
 This is a new feature in OpenHoldem version 2.0.
 The purpose of the Validator is to help people to develop more reliable
 bots and Table Maps.
 It will execute several hundred 
\begin_inset Index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Consistency-checks
\end_layout

\end_inset

consistency-checks at the symbol level to detect invalid game-states, 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mis-scrapes
\end_layout

\end_inset

mis-scrapes or incomplete information.
 The Validator will write possible problems to the log-file and also show
 a message box, as long as messages are not disabled.
 The rules used by the Validator are always being refined and developed.
 The discussion forum is the best place to keep on top of this (

Enable Validator
\emph default
: This preference determines when the Validator is engaged to do its work,
 either never (completely off), when it is my turn, or always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Use Heuristic Rules
\emph default
: Some rules are heuristic, i.e.
 they are "common sense", but not always true.
 Example: A game does usually not last longer than 2 minutes, so the autoplayer
 has to act at least once per 120 seconds.
 If it does not do so, there seems to be a problem.
 Maybe the Table Map does not detect the players cards or the buttons.
 This setting can result in false positives and is recommended for testing
 only, but not for real-money-play.

!!! Shoot replay-frame on error: 
\emph default
If the Validator discovers an inconsistency, and this preference is checked,
 OpenHoldem will shoot a 
\begin_inset Index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
replay
\end_layout

\end_inset

replay-frame and store it in the replay-folder.
 The replay frame will help you to find the source of the error.
