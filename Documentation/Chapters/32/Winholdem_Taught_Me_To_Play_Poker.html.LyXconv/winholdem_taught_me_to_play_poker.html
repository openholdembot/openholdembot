       Greetings folks,
       <!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >     This is a very exciting day for me. I have been working for
       almost a year to make this post.
       <!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >     Allow me to introduce my bot, Leviathan.
       <!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >     Image
       <!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >     I bought Winholdem almost a year ago. I had never seen code
       other than HTML, and my knowledge was basic in that. I also was
       not a very good poker player. I had decent skills, but just inhale,
       and you could smell the fishiness. I was usually not able to spot
       the sucker at the table. But I would win enough, often enough to
       keep me addicted to the game.
       <!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >     When I first bought Winholdem, I expected that it would win
       right out of the box. I put him on some play money tables, and
       sure enough he won.
       <!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >     So of course my next move was to immediately make a deposit,
       and sit him at the $1 tables, because we were soon going to be
       rich!..
       <!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >     A couple of days later, as I am sure you can guess I was sadly
       disappointed.
       <!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >     I   went   frantically   searching   through   the   forums,   and
       immediately  found  comfort  and  solace  in  the  hundreds  of  "I
       BOUGHT  WINHOLDEM  AND  IT  DOESNT  WIN  MONEY"
       noobie posts.
       <!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >     And then I read the short, ridiculing responses to these posts
       by some of the veteran members.
       <!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >     I started copying formula after formula from the forums into
       my bots, and over and over I kept being disappointed.
       <!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >     Then it occured to me, it was profound, it was monumental,
       angels sang from the heavens.. I was just going to have to learn to
       code my own bot.
       <!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >     So I stopped bitching about how I got duped into buying this
       worthless bot that plays poker like a semi-retarded monkey, and
       began the task of studying....
       <!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >     I read poker books. I read just about this entire forum. I read
       the help files, release notes, and tutorials provided by support I
       created a library of code taken from this site, and categorized it I
       lost a lot of money, and a lot of time I didnt give up
       <!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >     I now, having never seen code, and having been a much worse
       poker player than I am now, have a winning bot.
       <!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >     No, I will not sell the bot, because the price would be too high
       to match my future earnings. (100/200 is the future target) But
       for now its on the the 1/2 tables.
       <!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >     I want to express my gratitude for all of the veterans on this
       site who post regularly, and who have shared their code and ideas,
       and have withstood the little snots like me who whine and cry

       because I didnt get a million dollar money maker for 100 bucks.
       <!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >     I will now try to be more active on the forums, as I now feel
       that I have something to share.
