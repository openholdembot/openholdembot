\begin_layout Section
Choosing an operating system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem has been designed to work best on the 32-bit versions of Microsoft’s
 Windows 2000 or Windows XP operating systems.
 Any service pack level on these two choices seems to be fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recommend you avoid 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows Vista
\end_layout

\end_inset

Vista or its dependents (
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows 7
\end_layout

\end_inset

Windows 7, etc).
 These operating systems add a lot of useless cruft and bloatware that is
 not useful in this hobby.
 Most of the poker botters you will interact with in the community use these
 systems as well, so as you learn and exchange ideas, it is useful to be
 on the same platform.
 This is especially true of Table Maps.
 A TableMap designed for

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, as you scale your botting operation up, you want to keep things
 as lightweight as possible to best utilize the limited computing resources
 at your disposal.
 For this reason, 
\begin_inset Index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Windows 2000
\end_layout

\end_inset

Windows 2000 is often the choice of poker botters due to its very lean profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Configuring the operating system 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem requires specific system settings in order to correctly intuit
 the game state from the pixels on-screen, and to correctly take poker actions.

Color depth 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The display color depth must be set to 24-bit or 32-bit.
 Most Table Maps are designed for 32-bit color depth, so your display should
 be set to that for maximum compatibility with others’ work.
\end_layout

resolution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You need enough display resolution to contain both the poker client window
 and OpenHoldem at it smallest size (i.e.
 table view off).
 In general, the minimum acceptable display resolution is 1024x768.
 The smaller resolutions 800x600 and 640x480 do not have enough real estate
 to show both the poker client and OpenHoldem without overlapping windows.

Font smoothing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Font smoothing must be turned off in order to interpret font pixels correctly.
 Our objective is to interpret the pixels as presented by the poker client,
 and not post-mangled by the operating system.
 To disable font smoothing, right click the desktop, and choose Properties-->App
earance-->Effects.
 Disable smoothed fonts in this dialog.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows 2000 only has one window style.
 There are no themes, there is no candy blue coloring around windows, so
 you are OK if you use Windows 2000.
 With Windows XP, it is suggested to use the 
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Classic theme
\end_layout

\end_inset

“Classic” theme, which will present windows in the same style as Windows
 2000.
 You are of course free to use whatever theme you want, but be aware that
 public Table Maps usually do not work unless they are used with the same
 theme that they were designed for.
 Most OpenHoldem botters use Windows 2000 or the Windows XP Classic theme.

If you use Windows XP, it is recommended that you disable ClearType fonts,
 for the same reason that we suggest you disable font smoothing.

\begin_layout Section
Installing the software 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem and its supporting applications do not come with an installer.
 This is by design – installers tend to leave traces on your system, and
 in this hobby, the less traces, the better.
 Stealth will be discussed in greater depth in a later section, but this
 installer-less install is an important part of the stealth strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since you do not have an installer to do the work for you, there are several
 steps you need to take to correctly configure the software on your machine:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create your “OpenHoldem” base directory.
 For purposes of this walkthrough, we will create this directory as “c:
\backslash
mpb” (“My Poker Bot” – clever, eh?).
 You can make this directory anything you want, however
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Under c:
\backslash
mpb, create another directory “c:
\backslash
mpb
\backslash
scraper”; this directory is used by the “Green Circle Button” to automagically
 connect OpenHoldem to a poker table.
 More on this later.
 There is a non-automagic way to connect to tables, but at this point, you
 probably want this directory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Download the compiled binary packages.
 They can be found at the links in the {References} section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extract all the files from the compiled binary packages into the c:
\backslash
mpb directory.
 When done, your directory should look something like this, depending or
 course, on which programs you chose to extract.

OpenHoldem directory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this directory are the following files: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ManualMode.exe, OHReplay.exe, OpenHoldem.exe, OpenScrape.exe – these are the
 main files for each of the programs in the OpenHoldem project.
 Details on how to use each of these are throughout this manual.

 symbols that are described in this document.
 If you want to use versus symbols, you need this file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .pdb extensions – these files contain the debug symbols that are
 required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution in a
 debugger.
 If you need these, you know how to use these.
 If you don’t know what these are, you can safely ignore or delete them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .txt extensions – these are the release notes for each of the
 programs in the project.
 Feel free to peruse these if you have problems falling asleep some night.

Table Map 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The “scraper” directory should be where your Table Map files are stored.
 Table maps provide the OpenHoldem game state engine the instructions for
 deriving the state of the game from the pixels on the screen.
 These files have the “.tm” extension on them.
 The challenge with table maps is that every casino needs its own map.
 In some cases, you might need different maps for different game flavors.
 NL vs.
 FL, SNG vs.
 Ring, 10-seat vs.
 Heads-Up, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenHoldem project team does not provide official Table Maps for any
 casino or any Texas Hold’em game flavor.
 The reason for this is that there are thousands of casinos out there, and
 tens- or hundreds- of thousands of map combinations when you consider the
 different game flavors.
 Adding to that is the fact that casinos regularly update their client software
 and make minor or comprehensive changes to the pixels as they are displayed
 on the screen.
 These changes most often require changes to the table map as well.
 The OpenHoldem Project development team is a group of volunteers – we do
 not get paid for this, we have real lives and real families, and do this
 as a hobby.
 Maintaining working Table Maps would be a more than full time job, and
 thus instead, we put the power in your hands; we provide Table Map creation
 tools and testing tools to allow you to be self-sufficient.
 An explanation of the “OpenScrape” program, which is key to this self-sufficien
cy, will be provided in more detail later in this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, there are a number of places you can find pre-created maps for
 use with OpenHoldem.
 There is a section on the Wiki

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 that contains user-contributed maps.
 These maps are likely to be more or less out of date, and would require
 some validation to ensure they are 100% correct.
 Consider these maps to be a starting point for learning how maps are constructe
d and how they work.
 The forums have a lot of discussion on maps, and you can likely find maps
 attached to posts; same caveats apply as to the Wiki maps.
 You can try buying or trading maps with other community members – be cautious
 with this, however, and make sure you protect your interests; the OpenHoldem
 development team cannot be held accountable if you do something foolish
 on your own.
 Caveat emptor.

Uninstallation

\begin_layout Standard
We hope, you will never have to uninstall OpenHoldem on any of your machines.
 However we often see enthusiastic newbies, who download OpenHoldem and
 naively install it to their one and only machine without any attempts to
 stealth it.
 And then they ask, how they can get their computer clean again - be it,
 that they failed and want to play manually again, be it, that they want
 to create a clean setup for production.
