\begin_layout Section
Installing the software 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem and its supporting applications do not come with an installer.
 This is by design – installers tend to leave traces on your system, and
 in this hobby, the less traces, the better.
 Stealth will be discussed in greater depth in a later section, but this
 installer-less install is an important part of the stealth strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since you do not have an installer to do the work for you, there are several
 steps you need to take to correctly configure the software on your machine:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create your “OpenHoldem” base directory.
 For purposes of this walkthrough, we will create this directory as “c:
\backslash
mpb” (“My Poker Bot” – clever, eh?).
 You can make this directory anything you want, however
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Under c:
\backslash
mpb, create another directory “c:
\backslash
mpb
\backslash
scraper”; this directory is used by the “Green Circle Button” to automagically
 connect OpenHoldem to a poker table.
 More on this later.
 There is a non-automagic way to connect to tables, but at this point, you
 probably want this directory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Download the compiled binary packages.
 They can be found at the links in the {References} section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Extract all the files from the compiled binary packages into the c:
\backslash
mpb directory.
 When done, your directory should look something like this, depending or
 course, on which programs you chose to extract.
