Configuring the operating system

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem requires specific system settings in order to correctly intuit
 the game state from the pixels on-screen, and to correctly take poker actions.

Color depth 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The display color depth must be set to 24-bit or 32-bit.
 Most Table Maps are designed for 32-bit color depth, so your display should
 be set to that for maximum compatibility with others’ work.

resolution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You need enough display resolution to contain both the poker client window
 and OpenHoldem at it smallest size (i.e.
 table view off).
 In general, the minimum acceptable display resolution is 1024x768.
 The smaller resolutions 800x600 and 640x480 do not have enough real estate
 to show both the poker client and OpenHoldem without overlapping windows.

Font smoothing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Font smoothing must be turned off in order to interpret font pixels correctly.
 Our objective is to interpret the pixels as presented by the poker client,
 and not post-mangled by the operating system.
 To disable font smoothing, right click the desktop, and choose Properties-->App
earance-->Effects.
 Disable smoothed fonts in this dialog.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windows 2000 only has one window style.
 There are no themes, there is no candy blue coloring around windows, so
 you are OK if you use Windows 2000.
 With Windows XP, it is suggested to use the 
\begin_inset Index

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Classic theme
\end_layout

\end_inset

“Classic” theme, which will present windows in the same style as Windows
 2000.
 You are of course free to use whatever theme you want, but be aware that
 public Table Maps usually do not work unless they are used with the same
 theme that they were designed for.
 Most OpenHoldem botters use Windows 2000 or the Windows XP Classic theme.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use Windows XP, it is recommended that you disable ClearType fonts,
 for the same reason that we suggest you disable font smoothing.
