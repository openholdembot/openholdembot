\end_layout

 OpenHoldem has the ability to connect to this server, the primary benefit
 of which is the development of bot logic without risking real money.

 protocols is beyond the scope of this documentation, but extensive support
 on the topic can be found on the WinHoldem forums (

 you would like to have.
