\begin_layout Section
Hash Point Records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Description 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of Hash Point records is to define the pixels within a region
 that are used in a hash calculation.
 The “Hash0” transform always uses all pixels in a region to calculate its
 hash, so these records are only relevant for regions that use “Hash1”,
 “Hash2”, or “Hash3” transforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a one to one correlation between the “Hash1”, “Hash2”, or “Hash3”
 transforms and the group 1, 2 and 3 Hash Point records.
 For example, a region that calls for a “Hash2” transform will use the pixels
 specified by the group 2 Hash Point records in the hash calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The points defined for a Hash Point group must fall within the boundaries
 of the regions that you are calculating a hash for.
 Hash Points that fall outside of the region will be ignored, as they are
 invalid.
 For example, if you have card regions that are 10x20 pixels, then hash
 points (11,15) and (8,22) will be ignored, whereas hash points (5,5) and
 (9, 18) will be used in the hash calculation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manipulating hash point records using OpenScrape
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to create new Hash Point records:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.Select the “Hash Points” category in the record tree display on the Table
 Map Editor window, and click the “New” button.
 A window will be displayed that allows you to enter the hash point group
 and the X and Y parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Images/OS_NewHashPoint.bmp

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
OpenScrape: Hash Point Editor
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.Somewhat less intuitively, but ultimately easier to use, is to select the
 “Hash Points” category in the record tree display on the Table Map Editor
 window, and click the “Edit” button.
 A window will be displayed that allows you to select the hash point group,
 a sample image, and then interactively define the Hash Points for that
 group:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Images/OS_NewHashPointConfirmation.bmp

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
OpenScrape: New Hash Point
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you select a Hash Point group from the “Hash Type” control, the “Hash
 Point List” box will populate with all the Hash Points currently defined
 for that group.
 In this case, the box is empty, as we have not yet defined any Hash Point
 records for group 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After selecting an Image record in the “Sample Image” control (note you
 need to have Image records created first for this to work), the right side
 of the window will display that image and overlay the Hash Points for the
 selected group, like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
wide false
sideways false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Images/OS_NewHashPointWithImage.bmp

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The zoom level of the sample image can be adjusted with the “Zoom Level”
 control.
 Adding Hash Points can be done interactively by left-clicking on the sample
 image where the point is needed.
 Right clicking on an existing point in the sample image will remove it
 from the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clicking the “OK” button will then make the changes (adds and deletes) to
 the Table Map Hash Pointe record list.
 To edit an existing Hash Point record, select the record in the record
 tree display on the Table Map Editor window, and click the “Edit” button.
 A window will be displayed that allows you to edit the hash point group
 and the X and Y parameters.
 To delete an existing symbol record, select the record in the record tree
 display on the Table Map Editor window, and click the “Delete” button.
 A window will be displayed asking for verification of this action.
 An entire group of Hash Points can also be edited and/or deleted by selecting
 the “Hash Points” category in the record tree display on the Table Map
 Editor window, and clicking the “Edit” button.
 This will bring up the Graphical Hash Point Editor window, as described
 above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: The Insert and Delete keys can also be used as a shortcut for adding
 and deleting individual Hash Point records.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Technical Reference 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Table Map (.tm) file, these records will be preceded with the characters
 "p$".
 Hash point records have the following format: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p<n>$ <x> <y>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<n> is the group (1-3) that this hash point record belongs to <x> and <y>
 are the coordinates of the point, relative to the region's rectangle, the
 top left corner of which is 0,0.
 
\end_layout
