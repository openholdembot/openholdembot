 id="x1-20001"></a>What&#8217;s that all about</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >The following chapters will give you some introduction to anti-detection. They deal with
2-computer-stealth-setups, bring, VmWare, Ninja-folders and rootkits. These
methods are overkill and unneccessary for the majority of smaller sites (just
rename the executable and be good), but not enough for the very few sites that
care.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30001"></a>Which sites don&#8217;t care about bots</h3>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >As a rule of thumb, you don&#8217;t have to worry much at smaller sites. Smaller poker sites
usually don&#8217;t have the knowhow and the resources to really care about bots. They are a
good start for any new botter.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40001"></a>Which sites care about bots</h3>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Apart from Stars there are three sites, that are known to care: Cake, Party
and FullTilt. To our best knowledge they do care &#8212; sometimes and a little
bit.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-50001"></a>Your worst enemy</h3>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Your worst enemy are not casino security departments, but the players at your table.
Every bum at NL&#x00A0;2 owns Poker Tracker nowadays, so if you play too long hours, win too
much or run 20 accounts with identical stats you will be reported very soon. Once you
get reported, sites <span 
class="ecti-1000">have to </span>care, even if they actually love bots. They will have to
investigate your account and ban you. And they will be praised for their anti-bot-policy
on TwoPlusTwo, even more than sites which act proactive. So use your brain and stay
under the radar.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-60001"></a>&#8220;The best wife of all&#8221;</h3>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Nearly every day we have to deal with newbies, that have no clue at all, but want to bot
at PokerStars. They insist stubbornly on Stars and they hassle the regulars with
questions about the deepest secrets of stealth or beg for comments about the newest
&#8220;kickass-stealth-setup&#8221;, they just have invented. We simply can&#8217;t tell them &#8212;
except their setup will get their asses kicked; but that&#8217;s not, what they want to
hear.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Believe us, it is possible to bot at Stars, and the most honourable botters play there;
the great choice of soft tables and the friendly support are wonderful. But PokerStars
will require some advanced methods of anti-detection, so before you try to bot there,
consider the following points:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">As a rule of thumb 99% of all new botters fail horribly; they never reach
        the state, where they should play for real-money or worry about stealth.
        Why should we tell them all our secrets?

           </li>
        <li class="itemize">As a newbie you don&#8217;t have a winning bot, so there is no point at all to
        play for real money; you should concentrate on development first, using
        ManualMode and PokerAcademy.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Why Stars at all? There are so many things to care about: bot-logic,
        tablemaps, hoppers and stealth. Even if you have just created your first
        bot and are confident, that it is winning, it is adviceable to narrow down
        the number of issues, forget about stealth and start at smaller sites that
        care a bit less. Smaller sites have enough traffic and fishy games at the
        lower limits to give you a start. You have just rootet out one big issue
        and can concentrate on other problems; believe us, there will be enough
        of them.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Starting at smaller sites with a more simple setup will teach you the basics,
        that are a prerequiste to play at tougher sites one day.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Perfect stealth can&#8217;t be discussed in public obviously, so give us some time
        to get aquainted with you. Score lots of hero-points and maybe one day
        you will be a successful and honourable botter too. One day you will be
        allowed to ask <span
