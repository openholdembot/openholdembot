<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The general tool of choice for automation is AutoIt (<a

class="ectt-1000">http://autoitscript.com</span></a>). AutoIt
is a free (as in beer &#8211; this is not an open source program) Windows scripting language
and execution engine. From the web site:
        <!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >     &#8220;AutoIt is a freeware Windows automation language. It can
        be used to script most simple Windows-based tasks (great for
        PC rollouts or home automation). AutoIt has been in popular
        use since 1999 and continues to provide users and administrators
        with an easy way to script the Windows GUI. In February 2004
        the latest version of AutoIt - known as AutoIt v3 - was released
        and added powerful scripting features.&#8221;
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Automation of poker botting is one of those &#8220;simple Windows-based tasks&#8221; that AutoIt is
great for. The challenge is that now you have a new language to learn (does it ever end?),
but the support for AutoIt on their forums is astounding, and you can also get help on
the OpenHoldem forums.
