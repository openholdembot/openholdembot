<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Obscure preferences control various detectable components of OpenHoldem, and are
primarily useful in setting up a highly stealthed environment. See the {Stealth} chapter
for more information.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Window Class Name</span>: Every window running under Microsoft Windows
        has a specific &#8220;class name&#8221; associated with it. This is easily identifiable
        by the casinos&#8217; poker software and it is suggested that this be changed to
        something else.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Mutex  Name</span>:  OpenHoldem  uses  system-wide  mutexes  to  ensure  that
        multiple running instances of OpenHoldem do not interfere with each
        other when performing Autoplayer actions. The name of this system-wide
        mutex  is  easily  identifiable  by  the  casinos&#8217;  poker  software  and  it  is
        suggested that this be changed to something else.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Simple Main Window Title</span>: By default, OpenHoldem will include all sorts
        of useful information in its window title bar. This useful information is also
        easily identifiable by the casinos&#8217; poker software. Check this preference to
        use a simple window title instead.</li></ul>
