<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Start a casino, and open up a play money table. You can even use &#8220;observer&#8221; mode for
this activity if you like. Alternatively, once you learn how to use saved frames and
OHReplay, you can also connect OpenScrape to these saved frames while offline from the
casino.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   For now, let&#8217;s keep it simple. Once you have a poker table setup, startup the
OpenScrape program from the &#8220;c:\mpb&#8221; directory that you set up above. Arrange the
casino table window and the OpenScrape windows on your screen in such a way that
there is no overlap &#8211; OpenScrape needs a clear view of the poker table window to do its
job.

-->
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Connect OpenScrape to the casino table by clicking on the Green Circle Button on
the OpenScrape toolbar. A dialog with a list of top-level windows that are currently
visible on your screen will appear. Select the one from the list that matches your
casino table, and select OK. (Note, in this screenshot, we are connecting to a
&#8220;ManualMode&#8221; window. You will learn more about ManualMode later in this
document, but for now, just consider ManualMode to be a simulated, offline poker
table).

-->

<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   A static image of the poker table window will be displayed in OpenScrape&#8217;s
main window. Once OpenScrape has the poker table&#8217;s image displayed, you can
minimize the poker table if you want, to give yourself more room to work. As the
casino table changes state, and if you want to update the image that is displayed
in the OpenScrape main window, you can do so at any time by clicking on
the refresh button on the toolbar (Black and White arrows), or by choosing
View/Refresh from the menu. When a refresh is requested, OpenScrape will bring the
connected window to the front, grab the image, and then place it to the back again.
Additionally, if you have OpenScrape connected to an OHReplay window, it
automatically moves OHReplay to the next saved frame prior to grabbing the
image.

-->
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Once we have the poker table image in OpenScrape, it is time to start building our
Table Map, and providing the parameters that the OpenHoldem game state engine will
use to &#8220;read&#8221; the poker table.
