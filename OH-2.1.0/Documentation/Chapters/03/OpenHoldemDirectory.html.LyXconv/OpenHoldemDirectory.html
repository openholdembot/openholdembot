           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">ManualMode.exe,  OHReplay.exe,  OpenHoldem.exe,  OpenScrape.exe  &#8211;
        these are the main files for each of the programs in the OpenHoldem
        project. Details on how to use each of these are throughout this manual.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">dbghelp.dll &#8211; this is a Microsoft file that is used to produce memory dumps
        on critical errors. These memory dumps are useful for the developers to
        diagnose issues.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">keyboard.dll, mouse.dll, perl_callback.dll, scraper.dll, user.dll &#8211; these files
        are  all  extensions  to  OpenHoldem  that  you  can  use  to  customize  the
        software. More detail on all of these are provided in this document.

        <li class="itemize">versus.bin &#8211; this file is the large lookup table that is used by the versus
        symbols that are described in this document. If you want to use versus
        symbols, you need this file.

        <li class="itemize">Files with .pdb extensions &#8211; these files contain the debug symbols that
        are required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution in
        a debugger. If you need these, you know how to use these. If you don&#8217;t
        know what these are, you can safely ignore or delete them.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Files with .txt extensions &#8211; these are the release notes for each of the
        programs in the project. Feel free to peruse these if you have problems
        falling asleep some night.
