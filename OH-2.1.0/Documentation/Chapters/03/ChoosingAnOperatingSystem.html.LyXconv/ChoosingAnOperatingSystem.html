<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem has been designed to work best on the 32-bit versions of Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows 2000 or Windows XP operating systems. Any service pack level on these two
choices seems to be fine.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   We recommend you avoid Vista or its dependents (Windows 7, etc). These operating
systems add a lot of useless cruft and bloatware that is not useful in this hobby. Most of
the poker botters you will interact with in the community use these systems as well, so as
you learn and exchange ideas, it is useful to be on the same platform. This is especially
true of Table Maps. A TableMap designed for Windows XP is not very likely to work on
Vista.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Finally, as you scale your botting operation up, you want to keep things as
lightweight as possible to best utilize the limited computing resources at your disposal.
For this reason, Windows 2000 is often the choice of poker botters due to its very lean
profile.
