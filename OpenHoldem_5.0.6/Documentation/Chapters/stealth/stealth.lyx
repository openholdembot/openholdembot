\begin_layout Chapter
Stealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important consideration for any botter is that of stealth.
 Many casinos will attempt to detect the OpenHoldem software on your computer,
 and will either warn you or seize your account’s funds if they find it.
 There are two general approaches to addressing this problem, a “Single
 System” solution and a “Dual System” solution.
 OpenHoldem provides a number of facilities for achieving both of these
 setups and obscuring the program from detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that a “System” as discussed in this chapter can refer to a physical
 machine or a virtual machine.
 VMware Workstation is a popular choice for consumer system virtualization,
 but certainly you can make use of the other consumer virtualization products
 available, such as VirutalPC or VirtualBox.
 Addtionally, dasta center-class, bare metal hypervisor products such as
 VMWare ESX or Citrix XEN will work fine as well.
 See the {VMWare} section for information on configuring VMWare Workstation.
 Configuration of other virtualization platforms is not discussed in this
 documentation.
