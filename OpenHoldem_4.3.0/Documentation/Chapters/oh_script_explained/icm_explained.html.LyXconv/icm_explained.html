<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Here follows an overview of basic ICM push fold decisions and how they work with
OpenHoldem.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Equity</h4>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >This is obviously very important for botters - and all poker players in fact - to
know about. When applied to a pot, it is how much of the pot you currently
"own". Say I&#8217;m in a $30 pot heads-up, and neither player has looked at their
cards. I could say I&#8217;m entitled to half the pot. Now let&#8217;s take into account your
probability of winning. So say we have AKs and we&#8217;re up against JTo. Our
prwin is 0.65, so I should rightly feel I&#8217;m entitled to more than half the pot. We
could say we currently own 0.65 of the pot (0.65*30). This is our current "pot
equity".
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Equity doesn&#8217;t only apply to pots, it applies to tournaments (and to folding). If pot
equity is the portion of the pot we currently own, then tournament equity is the portion
of the tournament prize pool we currently "own". So if it&#8217;s a tournament of 2 people,
with a prize pool of $1 and we are equal in chips then I currently "own" half of the prize
pool or $0.5. My tournament equity is 0.5. This is what the OH symbol "icm" will
calculate for you: "my tournament equity before any action is considered (just
balances)". We thank OH for this, because once you have more than 2 players and
the prize structure is complicated then calculating the value for "icm" gets
harder.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   And we need to know what will happen to our tournament equity when my balance
changes from $0.5 to something else. If I fold, I can lose my blind so it will go down (or
stay the same if I didn&#8217;t put in a blind). If I go all-in it could double, go down to 0, or
increase slightly as I could win the blinds. And if I call an all-in it could double or
go to zero. Working out what will happen to the balances in such situations
- and the resulting value for my tournament equity - is all handled by OH.
Again, praise be to OH, because it gets complicated to calculate with more
players.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   So, using OH we can work out (using the ICM-calculator-symbols):
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">icm_fold - my tournament equity (TE) if I fold
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">icm_callwin - my TE if I call and win
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">icm_calllose - my TE if I call and lose
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">icm_alliwin0 - my TE if I go all-in and everyone else folds
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">icm_allilose1 - my TE if I go all in and lose (against 1 person)
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">icm_alliwin1 - my TE if I go all in and win (against 1 person)</li></ul>

<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Remember in the first example our equity changed once we looked at our cards? Well, so
too does our TE. This means we need to know our prwin. The more accurate a value for
prwin, the more accurately we can asses our TE. We <span 
class="ecti-1000">could </span>just use the standard OH
prwin, but that&#8217;s not advised. Better to put your opponent (remember we&#8217;re
just up against one person here) on a range of hands and then calculate the
prwin. So, how do we do that? Well, there&#8217;s Weighted Prwin, but I haven&#8217;t got
to grips with that yet. Instead, I went for $vs$prwin . We can get our prwin
via:

   </div>
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   This is our probabilty of winning (and 1/2 our prop of tying) against list#. List#
needs to be defined in your .ohf file. For example, say you have put your opponent on the
top 5% of hands. Put this in your .ohf

   </div>
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   So what I did was define hand lists for the top 5,10,20,30,40,60 percent of hands. I
then looked at my opponent&#8217;s chip stack. If he&#8217;s got under 5 bb then I reasoned he could
be pushing any two cards, 5-10 then pushing the top 50%, over 20BB then pushing the
top 10%. Of course this is guess work - some stacks might like to push light
with 20BB+, some might push tight. But once you start to look at the figures
and change your settings you&#8217;ll see that in most cases it doesn&#8217;t make <span 
class="ecti-1000">that</span>
much difference if they&#8217;re top 20 or top 50 - it can still be a clear push/call
whatever.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Probability of our opponent folding/calling. </h4>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >Just like we need to know the probability of us winning when we enter a pot, we also
need to know the chance our opponent will call/fold. For this, I simplified things and
again decided my probabilities according to my opponent&#8217;s chip stack. More than 20BB -
10% call probability, 10-19 - 20%, under 10 - 30%. I hate this oversimplification and can&#8217;t
wait to move to something more reliable (like the Poker Tracker Poker folded blind to
steal % maybe).
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Putting it all together</h4>
<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >So, we have our TEs, we have our prwin and we have the probability that our opponent
will fold/call. Now what? Well, it&#8217;s just like the first example. The pot size was
multiplied by our chances of winning it. Here we need to multiply each the TE equity in
each "situation" by the chances of that situation happening. Let&#8217;s take the simple
example again: 2 opponents fighting over a $1 pot, winner takes all, no blinds, 50c
stacks.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Do we call a push?</h5>
<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s say have AKs again and have worked out our prwin to be 0.65. OH tells us that our
icm_callwin is 1.000 and our icm_calllose is 0.000. Simple: we call and win, we get 1. We
call and lose: we have 0.
<!--l. 179--><p class="indent" >   We can either:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (a.i) Call and win. This probability it will happen is 1 (as we
        known we&#8217;re going to call it!) and the prob we win in 0.65. Multiply this
        by our "icm_callwin". This gives 0.65.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (a.ii) Call and lose. The prob it happens is again 1, and the prob
        we lose is (1-0.65). Multiply this by our icm_calllose. This gives 0.</li></ul>
<!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >So our total equity for scenario (a) is 0.65.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (b) Fold. Prob it happens is 1 if we know we&#8217;re going to fold.
        Multiply this my our icm_fold. This gives 0.5.</li></ul>
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >So, as you can see, scenario (a) gives us more equity. We should call!
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Do we push?</h5>
<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >Should we push? Same situation as before, but let&#8217;s add some 1-2 cent blinds and a 20%
prob we get called. What are our scenarios?

           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (a.i). Push, get called, and lose. == 1 * (prob of getting called)
        * (prob of losing) == 1 * 0.20 * (1-0.65) = 0.07. We need to multiply this
        by our icm_allilose1, which gives us 0.07*0 == 0.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (a.ii). Push, get called, and win. = 1 * (prob of getting called) *
        (prob of winning) == 1 * 0.20 * (0.65) = 0.13. We need to multiply this
        by our icm_alliwin1, which gives is 0.13 * 1.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (a.iii). Push, not get called, and win blinds. = 1 * (prob not get
        called) = 1 * 0.8 = 0.8. We need to multiply this by our icm_alliwin0,
        which gives us 0.8 * 0.52 (as we win the extra 2 cents from the small blind)
        = 0.416.</li></ul>
<!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >So in total our equity for Scenario a is 0 + 0.13 + 0.416 = 0.546.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Scenario (b) Fold. Again, our icm_fold which is 0.49 (if we fold, we lose
        our cent).</li></ul>
<!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" >So, once again the total equity for scenario (a) beats scenario (b). We should push!
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Multiple-Players</h4>
<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >Of course, all these calculations are just heads up. Once we go up against multiple
players we need much more info. If we&#8217;re the dealer pushing into the BB and SB, we need
to know the likelihood of <span 
class="ecti-1000">both </span>folding, <span 
class="ecti-1000">both </span>calling and our prwin against both, or
winning against one and not the other and claiming a side-pot. The maths gets a lot
more complicated. At the moment I&#8217;m just trying to master heads-up, I&#8217;m
afraid.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Conclusion </h4>
<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >All icm does is give you a picture of how much your chips are worth in certain scenarios.
The real skill is finding out the probability of those scenarios happening. For that, we
need accurate prwin and accurate folding probabilities.
