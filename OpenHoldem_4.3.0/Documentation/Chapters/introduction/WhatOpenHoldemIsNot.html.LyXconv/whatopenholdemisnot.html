<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem is not a complete poker bot. There is much work you need to do to utilize
the framework effectively, however this manual and the community on the forums can
help you to do so. If you truly desire a poker bot that includes logic written by
someone else, a quick Google search will turn up a number of likely candidates. Be
aware, however, that a pre-packaged, complete, click-Setup.exe-and-go, poker
bot is not a good way to be successful. Consistent and trusted positive results
from these pre-packaged bots are impossible to find. If pre-packaged bots really
worked, if we could have spent $20 to make $1000&#8217;s, we certainly would have
bought one ourselves, rather than spending the thousands of hours to create this
framework!
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   OpenHoldem does not allow for automated collusion. Poker botting currently is in a
gray area of legality and morality, with many strong perspectives on both sides of the
argument. The OpenHoldem development team strongly believes that automated
collusion is clearly illegal and immoral, and will not provide the facility to help you
achieve these ends.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   OpenHoldem is not a general-purpose poker botting engine for all styles of poker. It
is intentionally suited only to the "Texas Hold&#8217;em" flavor of poker favored by the
majority of online players today. Don&#8217;t ask if it supports Omaha - it doesn&#8217;t.
