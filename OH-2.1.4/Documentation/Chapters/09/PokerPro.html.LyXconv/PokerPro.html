<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >PokerPro is a poker server developed by Ray Bornert. OpenHoldem has the ability to
connect to this server, the primary benefit of which is the development of bot logic
without risking real money. The configuration of the PokerPro server and a
description of its network protocols is beyond the scope of this documentation,
but extensive support on the topic can be found on the WinHoldem forums
(<a

<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Due to undocumented changes in the communication-protocol the new PokerPro-server
is no longer useable for tournament-players. To simulate tournaments the older
2007-version is required (<a

<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   When the main menu item PokerPro/Go is selected, the following window will
appear:
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Figure 5.28-62 OpenHoldem PokerPro control
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The top of this window provides a group box that informs you of the connection
status to the PokerPro server.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   On the left third of the window, in the &#8220;Connect&#8221; group box is where the connection
details of the PokerPro server are specified. Additionally, you can choose to log
hand histories either in the default PokerPro format or in the Full Tilt format
here.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Once the server details are entered in the &#8220;Connect&#8221; group box, the &#8220;Connect&#8221;
button can be used to connect to the server.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Upon connecting to the PokerPro server with the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button, the &#8220;Tables&#8221;
group box in the middle third of the window will be populated with tables that are
available on the connected PokerPro server. If you would like PokerPro to automatically
seat you at a table when you join it, check the &#8220;Auto Seat&#8221; box and enter the amount of
starting chips you would like to have.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   After a table is selected from the &#8220;Tables&#8221; group box, you can join the selected table
by clicking the &#8220;Join Table&#8221; button.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Once a table has been joined, the &#8220;Sit Down&#8221;, &#8220;Buy Chips&#8221;, &#8220;Sit In&#8221; and &#8220;Deposit&#8221;
controls on the right third of the window will be enabled.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   The bottom portion of this window contains a large scroll box that displays messages
from the PokerPro server.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   This window can be closed, and OpenHoldem will maintain its connection to the
PokerPro server. To close the connection, reopen this window and choose the &#8220;Leave
Table&#8221; or &#8220;Disconnect&#8221; buttons as needed.
