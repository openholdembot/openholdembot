   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Configuring the operating system </h3>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem requires specific system settings in order to correctly intuit the game state
from the pixels on-screen, and to correctly take poker actions. They have to be
configured the right way before you can start working at your bot. Newer versions of
OpenHoldem help you with this task; they execute automatical configuration checks and
diagnose incorrect settings. However: you shouldn&#8217;t rely completely on these
configuration checks. Better get things right in advance. And be extra careful, if you use
a two-computer-stealth-setup: then it is a must to setup both PCs in absolutely the same
way.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Color depth </h4>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The display color depth must be set to 24-bit or 32-bit. Most Table Maps are designed
for 32-bit color depth, so your display should be set to that for maximum compatibility
with others&#8217; work.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Display resolution </h4>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >You need enough display resolution to contain both the poker client window and
OpenHoldem at its smallest size (i.e. table view off). In general, the minimum acceptable
display resolution is 1024x768. The smaller resolutions 800x600 and 640x480 do not have
enough real estate to show both the poker client and OpenHoldem without overlapping
windows.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Font smoothing </h4>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >Font smoothing must be turned off in order to interpret font pixels correctly. Our
objective is to interpret the pixels as presented by the poker client, and not post-mangled
by the operating system. To disable font smoothing: right click the desktop,
and choose Properties&#8211;&#x003E;Appearance&#8211;&#x003E;Effects. Disable smoothed fonts in this
dialog.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Window style (themes)</h4>
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Windows 2000 only has one window style. There are no themes, there is no candy
blue coloring around windows, so you are OK if you use Windows 2000. With
Windows XP (or later), it is suggested to use the &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme, which will
present windows in the same style as Windows 2000. You are of course free to use
whatever theme you want, but be aware that public Table Maps usually do
not work unless they are used with the same theme that they were designed
for. Most OpenHoldem botters use Windows 2000 or the Windows XP Classic
theme.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Windows XP and ClearType </h4>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >If you use Windows XP, it is recommended that you disable ClearType
(<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType</span></a>) fonts, for the same reason that we
suggest you disable font smoothing. Here is the link to the Microsoft web page on how to
do this: <a 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx " class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx</span></a>.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Language settings</h4>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Your language settings affect the behaviour of your system in several ways:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">how to display special characters
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">what to use as the decimal separator: dot or comma.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">the language used by your poker-client</li></ul>
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Language settings may seem to be nearly irrelevant if you are a newbie, but incorrect settings
can affect the scraper engine and the autoplayer severly, even up to complete failure. The
only settings, that are guaranteed to work are english ones. Others may or may not be
compatible. If you are new to botting be smart and stay on the safe side; there have been
more than enough lengthy threads by desperate newbies &#8212; mostly caused by incorrect
settings.
