<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem has the ability to create &#8220;Replay Frames&#8221;, either automatically as set in
{Preferences}, or when the &#8220;camera&#8221; icon on the main toolbar {Toolbars} is clicked. A
&#8220;Replay Frame&#8221; (or &#8220;frame&#8221; for short), is a combination of a Windows bitmap-formatted
image file (.bmp) and an associated HTML file. These two files, in combination, provide
an easy way to reproduce and diagnose a particular game situation. This is extremely
helpful in the building and testing of your Table Maps and bot logic in an offline fashion.
Simply connect OpenHoldem to a live poker table, and collect interesting frames for later
use. Then at a later time, use {OHReplay} to display these frames. Further connect
OpenScrape or OpenHoldem to these OHReplay-displayed frames and work at your
leisure.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   The HTML provides crucial context for the frame, the most important of which is
the title text. This text is used exhaustively in most Table Maps to understand the game
state.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Often, when you post a problem or discussion on the forums, you will be asked to
provide a frame and Table Map to help the developers diagnose your problem. Feel free
to open the bitmap image in your favorite image editor (MS Paint?) and black out the
sensitive portions if needed. Be aware that blacking out some parts of the image
may prevent the developers or community from helping you, so be careful with
that.

<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Frames are created in a &#8220;replay&#8221; directory directly under the directory from which
you launched OpenHoldem. The .bmp files are large, so ensure that you have enough
space to hold the maximum number of frames you specified in {Preferences}. Once the
maximum number is reached, OpenHoldem will start reusing frame numbers from the
beginning.
