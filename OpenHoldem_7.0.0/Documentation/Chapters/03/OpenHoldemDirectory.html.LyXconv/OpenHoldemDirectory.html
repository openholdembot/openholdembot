        <li class="itemize">dbghelp.dll &#8212; this is a Microsoft file that is used to produce memory
        dumps  on  critical  errors.  These  memory  dumps  are  useful  for  the
        developers to diagnose issues.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">keyboard.dll,                                                                  mouse.dll,

        <li class="itemize">versus.bin &#8212; this file is the large lookup table that is used by the versus
        symbols that are described in this document. If you want to use versus
        symbols, you need this file.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Files with .pdb extensions &#8212; these files contain the debug symbols that
        are required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution in
        a debugger. If you need these, you know how to use these. If you don&#8217;t
        know what these are, you can safely ignore or delete them.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Files with .txt extensions &#8212; these are the release notes for each of the
        programs in the project. Feel free to peruse these if you have problems
        falling asleep some night.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Files with .ini extensions &#8212; these are configuration files; they can be used
        for easy deployment on new machines or to avoid traces in the registry.
