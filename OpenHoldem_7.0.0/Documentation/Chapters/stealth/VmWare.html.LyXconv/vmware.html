<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >This is a guide to show you how to get OpenHoldem running securely on a single
computer using the VMware Server application as a second, "virtual" computer. Original
post by Tammelinn: <a 
href="http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894</span></a>
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   The guide assumes no special knowledge, but you will need some basic computer
skills. You will need to know how to install software, how to rename files, how to
navigate folders and so on.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   I am also assuming that you are using the same operating system as me. If you are
using Windows XP Media Centre Edition or Windows XP Professional, you
can use this guide. If you are using some other brand of Windows (including
Vista), the guide might not be reliable. I have only tested these instructions with
XP.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Much of this information is already available elsewhere. In many cases, all I have
done is to reword it a little.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Definitions </h4>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >The "real" computer is the one that is sitting on your desk or on your lap. It has its own
operating system. The "virtual" computer is the one we are going to create using
VMware Server. We can think of the "virtual" computer as a separate computer
with its own operating system, even though it is physically part of the "real"
computer.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Step 1 - Download VMware Server </h4>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >VMware Server is a free download from <a 
href="http://www.vmware.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.vmware.com</span></a>. You will need to
provide VMware with a valid e-mail address to get a serial number. I used version 1.0.3
while writing this guide.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   You will also need a Windows installation disk or an ISO-image of e.g. TinyXP. I am
using a Windows XP Professional installation DVD, which I&#8217;m going to install as my
"virtual" operating system.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   While you wait for the download to finish, you should read the whole of this guide
and make sure that you understand it. It would be a good idea to print it out, if you
can.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Do not install any software </span>until you are told to.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Step 2 - Install VMware Server on your real computer </h4>
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Double-click on the VMware Server file you downloaded and it will begin installing itself.
When you are asked if you want a "complete" or "custom" installation, choose
"complete". A big window with some warnings about "IIS" might appear. We
don&#8217;t need IIS, so just click &#8220;OK&#8221;. When the installer asks for Internet access,
grant it. Wait for the installation to complete before moving on to the next
step.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Step 3 - Configure VMware Player </h4>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Double-click on the "VMware Server" icon that should have appeared on the desktop of
your real computer. VMware Server will start for the first time. A Pop-up window asks
you to choose between a local host and a remote host. Choose "local host" and click
"OK".
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   Click the "New Virtual Machine" icon and a window will appear. Choose "typical"
and click "next". Now choose which operating system you want to install on your
virtual computer. Here, I selected the "Microsoft Windows" option, and the
version I selected was "Windows XP, Professional". if you want to install from a
CD-image and not from a real CD then just point VMware to the location of the
ISO-image.
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   The next window gives you two boxes to fill in. The first box gives you a chance to
name your new virtual computer. Choose any name you like.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   The second box ("Location") allows you to choose where the Virtual computer will
be saved on your hard drive. You probably don&#8217;t need to change the contents of this box.
(The virtual computer is actually a single file which exists on the hard drive of your real
computer. If you want this file to be in a different folder or even on a different partition,
you can tell VMware now.)
<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   Next you must choose the type of network. Choose "Use bridged networking".
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   The next window asks you to decide how big the virtual computer&#8217;s virtual hard
drive is going to be. The suggested 8GB is quite enough for the purposes of playing
poker. Click "Finish" when you are ready. Some operating-systems like Windows 2000 or
TinyXP will be satisfied with a bit less disk space, but don&#8217;t forget that you also need
space for casino-software, hand-histories and maybe PokerTracker. Better safe than
sorry.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   VMware will thereafter spend quite a few minutes creating the virtual computer.
Wait until the installation is complete. You should be looking at a brand-new installation
of Windows XP. If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games -
Solitaire") then you are ready to move on to the next step.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Step 4 - Install an operating system on the virtual computer</h4>
<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >When VMware is ready, you&#8217;ll see a new window with some details about the virtual
computer. Find "Start this virtual machine" on the left and click it. VMware will
now look for the Windows installation disk in your CD/DVD drive. Put the
installation disk in the drive and Windows will begin installing onto your virtual
computer.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >   Soon, Windows will ask you if you want to format your hard drive. Only the
virtual hard drive of the virtual computer is going to get formatted, so you
don&#8217;t need to worry about the data on your real hard drive. It is perfectly safe.
If you asked how you want to format the virtual hard drive, make sure you
choose one of the NTFS options. (Do not choose any option with FAT16 or
FAT32).
<!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, Windows will ask you to enter your full name. We are going
to create three seperate users, so choose a name for the first user ("Jessica",
for example) and enter it here. This user will have permanent administrator
privileges.
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   Next, enter an administrator password for this user. Write down the name and
password now.

<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Administrator name and password </span>_________________________
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >   Later, Windows will ask you to enter up to five user names. The first user - the box
labelled "your name" - should be the same as the user you entered above ("Jessica").
Don&#8217;t fill in the other boxes yet.
<!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >   Wait until the installation is complete. You should be looking at a brand-new
installation of Windows XP. If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games
- Solitaire") then you are ready to move on to the next step.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Step 5 - Install VMTools, Firewall and Antivirus on virtual computer </h4>
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >VMTools is a package which, among other things, gets the mouse to move smoothly
between the real and the virtual computer. You need to install it now, so press
CTRL+ALT to restore mouse control to the real computer. Then, on the VMware Server
window, click on the menu option VM, and then choose "Install VMTools..." VMTools
will now install itself inside the virtual computer. The virtual computer will need to
reboot.
<!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >   After the reboot, find the VMTools icon in the system tray, next to the clock. It
looks like three small interlinked squares. When you have found it, double-click on
it.
<!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >   A window appears and the "Options" tab is already showing. Find the line "Show
VMware Tools in the taskbar" and click on it, so that there is no longer a tick next to
it. Click &#8220;OK&#8221; to save your changes. This measure prevents the casino from
seeing that you&#8217;re using VMware - just in case they take a screenshot of your
desktop.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   Now, your virtual computer is connected to the Internet, so it needs firewall software
and antivirus software, just as your real computer does. Install the software (connect to
the Internet to download it, if you have to), and then run a scan to check that your
virtual computer is free from viruses.
<!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >   (You could use AVG Antivirus (<a 
href="http://free.grisoft.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://free.grisoft.com</span></a>), and Zonealarm
Firewall (<a 
href="http://www.zonealarm.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.zonealarm.com</span></a>))
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Step 6 - Check that the real and virtual computers can communicate</h4>
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" >If the real computer and the virtual computer can&#8217;t communicate with each other, all
your efforts in securing them will be wasted. Let&#8217;s check the communications
now.
<!--l. 214--><p class="indent" >   The traditional way to test a network is to have one computer "ping" the other. A
ping is a short signal which one computer sends to another. The signal will get bounced
back if the network is running as it should.
<!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   Before pinging anything, you need to turn off the firewalls on both computers. If you
have installed a firewall such as Zonealarm, switch it off. Now click "Start - Control
Panel - Security Centre". At the bottom of the window is an option to "Manage security
settings for: Windows Firewall". Click on "Windows Firewall" and make sure it is off. Do
this on both computers.
<!--l. 226--><p class="indent" >   Now you need to find out the IP address for both computers. (An IP address is a
numerical address which computers on a network use to identify each other.)
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >   On your real computer, click "Start - Run". Type "cmd" in the box and press
return.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >   A new window appears. Type &#8220;ipconfig" and press return. You will see a

series of numbers, some of which are marked "IP address". Find the one that
corresponds to the type of Internet connection you have - for example, the one
labeled "wireless connection" if you connect to the Internet through a wireless
router.
<!--l. 240--><p class="indent" >   The IP address of my real computer is 192.168.1.4 - yours probably looks almost the
same. Write it down now.
<!--l. 243--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Real computer IP address</span>_________________________
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >   Now do the same thing on your virtual computer. Find the IP address and write it
down. The IP address of my virtual computer is 192.168.1.7 - yours will be
similar.
<!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Virtual computer IP address </span>_________________________
<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >   On your real computer, find the new window again and type "ping x.x.x.x", then
press return. Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of your virtual computer. You should
see something like this...

replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address of your real computer. If you get a response,
your network is set up properly and you can continue to the next step. If the
network isn&#8217;t set up properly, you should seek help from someone who understands
networks.
<!--l. 294--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t forget to <span 
class="ecti-1000">turn your firewalls back on again </span>when you finish this step. If you
have a good firewall such as Zonealarm, you can leave the less powerful Windows
firewall turned off permanently (on your real computer as well as your virtual
computer).
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Step 7 - Set up user accounts on virtual computer </h4>
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >Click "Start - Control Panel - User Accounts".
<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   You had already set up one user while installing Windows. This user already has
admin privileges. We&#8217;ll call it the "admin" user. We need to give this user a password. It
can be the same password you used in step 4. Click on the user, then click on "create a
password". Enter the password into the boxes and click on "create password". The next
window asks you if you want to make your files and folders private. You certainly do,
so click "Yes, make private". Click on "Back" to return to the user accounts
window.

<!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >   Now we&#8217;ll set up two new users with fewer privileges. You will be logged in as the
second user whenever you connect to a casino. We&#8217;ll call this the "casino" user. The third
user will be created to hide things from the casino. We&#8217;ll call this the "stealth"
user.

Click the &#8220;Add" button. In the "Enter the object names to select" box, type in the name
of the stealth user (for example, my stealth user is called James). Click the "OK" button.
There should now be a new entry in the list. My stealth user shows up as &#8220;James
(XPPRO/James)" in that list.
<!--l. 385--><p class="indent" >   Now we need to remove every user except the stealth user from the list. Click the
"Advanced" button. Find the line which says "Inherit from parent the permission

line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." should no longer have a
tick next to it. Click the &#8220;OK&#8221; button. Another warning pop-up might appear. If it does,

click "Remove", then &#8220;OK&#8221;. The list of users should now have only one user in it, the
stealth user.
<!--l. 396--><p class="indent" >   Find the "Full control" line. In the "allow" column, there is a small box. Click on it,

computer) to see what the casino software (on the virtual computer) is doing. There
are several ways of doing this. We are going to use a piece of software called
"Bring".

<!--l. 466--><p class="indent" >   On the virtual computer, log in as the stealth user. Now go to the official
WinHoldem site (See {Bring}) and download "bring.exe" (from the "stealth" page).
Download it directly into the Ninja folder: <a

<!--l. 471--><p class="indent" >   The casino software can&#8217;t see inside the Ninja folder, but it will be able to
see Bring being run as a process. (If you want to see all the processes your
computer is running, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then click on the "processes"
tab.)
<!--l. 476--><p class="indent" >   The solution is to rename Bring to something more innocent. Then, if the casino
software looks at the processes you are running, it won&#8217;t be able to find out anything
incriminating about Bring.
<!--l. 480--><p class="indent" >   Rename Bring now. For example, you could rename it to "notepad" or
&#8220;paint".

<!--l. 486--><p class="noindent" >You can now install Bring on your real computer. You don&#8217;t need to rename it; the

<!--l. 489--><p class="indent" >   Open a folder on the desktop, call it "Bring", and download into it the files

<!--l. 766--><p class="indent" >   If you can see the message "OpenProcess failed with error 5 (Access is denied)", then
you will know for sure that the casino user can&#8217;t find out anything incriminating about
Bring. Your security checks are now complete.
<!--l. 771--><p class="indent" >   Close Notepad, solitaire and the &#8220;cmd.exe" shortcut. Delete Gaze from your desktop
and empty the recycle bin. Terminate the Bring process. Reboot the virtual

computer.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000"></a>Step 18 - Install the casino software </h4>
<!--l. 778--><p class="noindent" >You can now install the casino software. On the virtual computer, log in as the casino
user. Create a new folder on the desktop called "poker". It&#8217;s a good idea to install all
your casino software in a single folder.
<!--l. 783--><p class="indent" >   The casino user currently has restricted privileges. Some casinos insist that you
install their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Some
casinos also insist that you run their software when logged in as a user with
administrative privileges. Preferably, we would like to install and run the software while
logged in as a user has restricted privileges.
<!--l. 790--><p class="indent" >   Here is how to set up a typical casino&#8217;s poker software.
<!--l. 792--><p class="indent" >   Still logged in as the casino user, go to the casino web site. Download their software
directly into the poker folder you created moments ago. Go into the folder and double
click on the software. It will begin installing. When the install asks where you would like
to install the software, choose the "poker" folder you created moments ago. Don&#8217;t let the
install the use the default folder.
<!--l. 800--><p class="indent" >   If the installation completes without complaints, all is well. However, if the
installation complaints that it needs administrative privileges, this is what you must
do:
<!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >   Log out from the casino user&#8217;s account and log in to the admin user&#8217;s account. Open
the "User Accounts" window just as you did before. Click on the casino user act and
then click on "Change the account type". Click on "Computer Administrator" and then
click the "Change Account Type" button. Log out from the admin user&#8217;s account and log
back into the casino user&#8217;s account.
<!--l. 813--><p class="indent" >   Try to install the software again. This time it should install without complaints. Now
log out of the casino user&#8217;s account and go back to the admin user account. Change the
casino user&#8217;s account type back to "limited". Log out of the admin user account and log
back into the casino user&#8217;s account.
<!--l. 819--><p class="indent" >   Now try running the software. If the software complaints that it needs administrative
privileges to run, change the casino user&#8217;s account to "Computer Administrator" just as
you did above. It&#8217;s unfortunate that you have to run the software with administrative
privileges, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world.

 id="x1-21000"></a>Step 19 - Change your video settings </h4>
<!--l. 828--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem is quite fussy about which desktop theme you are using. Currently, only the
Windows XP default style and the Windows 2000 classic style are supported. You must
change your desktop theme to one of these styles on both the real computer and the
virtual computer. Click "Start - Control Panel - (Appearances and Themes) - Change the
computer&#8217;s theme" to do this.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-22000"></a>Step 20 - Start playing poker </h4>
<!--l. 839--><p class="noindent" >On the virtual computer, start Bring by using the &#8220;cmd.exe" shortcut. Start the casino
software and choose the table. Make sure the table&#8217;s window is not obscured by any
other Windows.
<!--l. 843--><p class="indent" >   Now go to your real computer, start Bring and try to get the table to appear in a
window. If everything has been set up properly, you should be able to control the table

from your real computer.
<!--l. 847--><p class="indent" >   Now start OpenHoldem. Press OpenHoldem&#8217;s &#8220;Green Circle Button&#8221; button and
you&#8217;re ready to make money!

<!--l. 854--><p class="noindent" >Every time you use OpenHoldem to play poker for you, you must follow this simple
checklist.
