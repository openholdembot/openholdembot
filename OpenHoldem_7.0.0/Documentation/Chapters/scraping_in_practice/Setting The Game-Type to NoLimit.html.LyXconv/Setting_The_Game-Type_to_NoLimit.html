<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >If you create a tablemap it is pretty important to tell OpenHoldem which game-type you
are playing. If you play fixed limit the mimimum bet will double up at the turn. So if you
play a $1/2-game the blinds will be $0.50 and $1. The small bet, as it is called, will be
$1. That means your mimimum bet and all raises have to be at least 1 dollar. But the
pot will grow, and betting $1 into a large pot doesn&#8217;t make much sense. So at the turn
the betsizes double up and the now so-called big-bet would be $2 in our example.
This results in a $0.50/$1/$2 betting-structure, contrary to the now famous
no-limit with a $0.50/$1/$1-structure, where can choose your betsize as you like
and the minimum bet at later streets would be the same as preflop and at the
flop.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Why this elementary introduction? Because some players nowadays don&#8217;t even know
about the old days where fixed-limit was the only game of choice in the internet.
But does that matter and how does it affect players who want to play only
no-limit?
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Well, per default open assumes a fixed-limit game. Therefore it will assume that the
minimum bet (the symbols &#8220;bet&#8221;, &#8220;bet3&#8221; and &#8220;bet4&#8221;) will double up and as a concequence
lots of other symbols (like &#8220;nbetstocall&#8221;) will only be half as large as they would be in a
no-limit-game.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   So to make a map work properly you have to tell OpenHoldem the game-type, but
this information can be scraped, just like anything else that matters.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Using openscrape:
           <ol  class="enumerate1" >
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">Create the region "c0limits0".
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1004x2">Optimally you want to choose a region at the table that displays no-limit,
        but if that is not present you might choose any fake-region that doesn&#8217;t
        change, like &#8220;Options&#8221;. Create letters that return NL for whatever is shown
        in the region. Use a font that doesn&#8217;t get used for anything else to avoid
        conflicts (I used text1). I created a small region over the options field and
        instead of teaching OH the letter &#8217;O&#8217; and &#8217;p&#8217;, I told it it stands for &#8217;N&#8217;
        and &#8217;L&#8217; because I want a no limit map.
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1006x3">Under "symbols" create c0limits0 and edit it to return the limit (^L) as
        advertised in the manual (well, somewhere else).
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1008x4">Live happily ever after.</li></ol>
