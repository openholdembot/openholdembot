<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Image records serve multiple purposes. The first purpose is for regions that use the Image
transform. When a region requires this type of lookup, the screen scraper engine will first
look for an exact pixel-for-pixel image match in the Image records, and if no match is
found, will then look for the closest match (with the 65% tolerance, as described
in the Region Records {Technical Reference} section). The second purpose
of the Image records is to serve as a reference from which Hash records are
created (see the {Hash Records} section). Note: Image transforms are very CPU
intensive, as they require 2 passes through the Image records, the first to try to find
an exact match, and the second to find a closest match. Each pass requires a
comparison of every single pixel in the region. For large regions, this is a lot
of comparisons. The time required to do Image transform lookups is directly
proportional to the number of Image records present, and the size of the requesting
Region record. It almost always makes more sense to use the Hash transform
to do image matching, as the Hash lookup algorithm is orders of magnitude
faster.

<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   The &#8220;Create Image&#8221; button on the Table Map Editor window is used to create new
Image records. This button is only available if a region record has previously been
selected.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   When the &#8220;Create Image&#8221; button is clicked, the following window will appear:
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   <img

name="imagerecords1x.png" src="1E__OH_SVN_trunk_Documentation_Chapters_tablemaps_images_OS_NewImage.eps"  
-->
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   The only required piece of information on this window is the name of the Image
record, however, the name you choose is crucially important, as this name is
what is returned to the game state engine directly for an Image transform,
and is what is populated on the Hash record when you create a hash from this
image.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   The name is dependent on what the image is used for, but for example, if
this is an image of the ace of clubs, you would want to name it &#8220;Ac&#8221;. If this
is an image of a dealer button, you would want to name it &#8220;dealer&#8221;. (See the
Region Records section, {Technical Reference}, for valid return values for each
region)
