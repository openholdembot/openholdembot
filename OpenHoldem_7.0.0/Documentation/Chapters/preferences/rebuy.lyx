Rebuy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rebuy preferences control when and how OpenHoldem executes the external
 rebuy-script.
 See the {The Automation} section for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Change in handnumber: 
\emph default
This option will cause OpenHoldem to wait at least for a new hand before
 doing a second rebuy.
 It is a simply sanity-check to prevent too many rebuys, as most casinos
 will increase your balance only after the end of the current hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
No cards: 
\emph default
This option will prevent rebuys as long as you are involved in a hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Heuristic occlusion check: 
\emph default
Rebuys are especially volatile against misscrapes of the balance, which
 could be caused e.g.
 by temporary occlusion (The truths is: OpenHoldem will keep the last known
 balance, if it can't scrape the balance correctly.
 But it's always good to have another safety-net, isn't it?).
 The option to do heuristic occlusion checks will cause OpenHoldem to look
 at other players names and balances to guess, if heros balance is occluded.
 In case of a probable occlusion the rebuy-process won't be started.
 Heuristic occlusion checks will add some extra safety, but they won't catch
 every misscrape; e.g.
 the very unfortunate case of a partial occluded, but non-zero balance will
 still get accepted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Minimum time to next rebuy: 
\emph default
This option is another sanity check to prevent to much rebuys in a short
 period of time.
 The time difference gets specified in seconds.
