This documentation consists of three parts
* LyX-files (LyX is a graphical frontend for the mathematical typesetting system LaTeX)
* html-files, that have been created automatically from the LyX-docu
* a "compiled HTML-help-file" (OpenHoldem_Manual.chm)

To modify the docu:
* First you need LyX. You can get it from http://www.lyx.org/.
* The style of all parts is AMS-book (AMS = American Math society)
* Numbering is turned off (menu -> document -> properties)
* Once you have edited the LyX-files, you should export them to HTML
* Now you should run the script"postprocess_generated_HTML_files.pl"
  It will apply some changes like background.colour, etc.
* Finally you need MicroSofts HTML Help Workshop
  (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc)
  This program makes it possible to create a structured help-file
  from your html-files (first open the *.hhp file)

Don't worry - it is quite easy, you will see.
