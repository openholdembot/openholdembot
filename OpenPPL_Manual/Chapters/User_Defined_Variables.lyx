\begin_layout Chapter*
User-Defined Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most probably you need some game-history to take your decision; then you
 will find symbols like NoBettingOnFlop and OpenHoldems history symbols
 and they will be useful for a good portion os use-cases, but identifying
 very special situations afterwards only with the built-in symbols might
 be hard or even impossible.
 So wouldn't it be helpful if you could remember what happened in the game?
 Of course you can - with user-defined variables.
 Let's take a small example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (FirstCallerPosition = 9) User_UTG_Was_Limping
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As you see, there is a user-defined variable instead of an action after
 a condition, but no keyword force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whenever OpenPPL / OpenHoldem sees such a construct it evaluates the when-condit
ion.
 If the condition is true, OpenHoldem sets the user-variable to true and
 continues with the evaluation, until it finds a true condition with an
 action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All user-defined variables start with false (0).
 Once you set them they become true (or 1, which is technically the same).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User-defined variables keep their value for the current hand and can't be
 reset back by the user.
 But when the hand is over they get reset automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Naming: every user-defined variable start with the prefix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

User
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, followed by a sequence of characters [a-zA-Z], digits [0-9] and underscores
 [_].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Querying the value of a variable is simple: you can use it just like any
 other symbol as part of an expression:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

CUSTOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

PREFLOP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (Hand = AA) RAISEMAX FORCE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (Hand = KK) UserDoesNotKnowWhatToDo 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (Hand = QQ) UserStartsToCry 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (UserDoesNotKnowWhatToDo) CALL FORCE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (UserStartsToCry) SITOUT FORCE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN Others FOLD FORCE
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

Expert Tricks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you need variables that can be set to any arbitrary value? Do you need
 variables that can be reset back? Do you need variables that don't reset
 automatically, but keep their values till the next hand or even for the
 complete session? There is a solution for it (of course).
 Instead of PPL-like user-variables it is also possible to use OpenHoldems
 memory-store-command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (...) me_st_MySecretVariable_3_141592653
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and then use it later with OpenHoldems memory-recall-command:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (...
 me_re_MySecretVariable ...) ...
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This construct is a little bit more mighty, but also contains some possible
 pitfalls and requires extra care by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OpenHoldems user-defined variables are case sensitive.
 me_st_x_1 is something different than me_st_X_1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No underscores allowed in the name of the variable.
 Underscores are used to separate name and value.
 (If you wonder, why underscores are allowed in simple user-variables: because
 the translator removes them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No automatic reset.
 If you need such a reset, you could do it e.g.
 before your first action preflop:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

CUSTOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

PREFLOP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

WHEN (BotsActionsOnThisRound)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    WHEN Others me_st_MySecretVariable_0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

    ...
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
May the force be with you!
\end_layout
