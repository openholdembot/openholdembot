<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Of course OpenPPL supports the main features of OpenPPL, especially:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">an easy english-like programming language, that can be learned in no
        time.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">a library of several hundred ready-to-use functions for an easy start.</li></ul>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Besides of that OpenHoldem / OpenPPL provide some additional cool functionality that you
might have missed
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">knowing the stacksize of every single player.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">the ability to play at any casino you want, provided you create a tablemap
        for it.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">the ability to develop and debug your bots with tools like ManualMode,
        PokerAcademy and PokerTH. Did you ever want to simulate A2o at the
        button or a flushdraw out of position several dozen times until you are
        satisfied?
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">an auto-connector, that handles up to 25 tables at once with less than
        1%  CPU-overhead.  All  you  have  to  do:  open  a  table  and  sit-down.
        OpenHoldem connects automatically (one instance per table) and starts
        to play.</li></ul>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >If you are an expert you might want to make use of some advanced features:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">building symbols on your own.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">accessing Openholdems native symbols, including PokerTracker symbols
        and hand-range calculations on the fly.</li></ul>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >And the best of all:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">you can contribute to the project to make it even better.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">it&#8217;s all for free. Well - nearly free; of course it requires a bit of learning
        and some work to become a master.</li></ul>
