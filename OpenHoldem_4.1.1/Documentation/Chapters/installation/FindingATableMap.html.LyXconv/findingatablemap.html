<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The &#8220;scraper&#8221; directory should be where your Table Map files are stored. Table maps
provide the OpenHoldem game state engine the instructions for deriving the state of the
game from the pixels on the screen. These files have the &#8220;.tm&#8221; extension on them. The
challenge with table maps is that every casino needs its own map. In some cases, you
might need different maps for different game flavors. NL vs. FL, SNG vs. Ring, 10-seat
vs. Heads-Up, for example.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The OpenHoldem project team does not provide official Table Maps for any
casino or any Texas Hold&#8217;em game flavor. The reason for this is that there are
thousands of casinos out there, and tens- or hundreds- of thousands of map
combinations when you consider the different game flavors. Adding to that is
the fact that casinos regularly update their client software and make minor or
comprehensive changes to the pixels as they are displayed on the screen. These changes
most often require changes to the table map as well. The OpenHoldem Project
development team is a group of volunteers &#8212; we do not get paid for this, we
have real lives and real families, and do this as a hobby. Maintaining working
Table Maps would be a more than full time job, and thus instead we put the
power in your hands; we provide Table Map creation tools and testing tools to
allow you to be self-sufficient. An explanation of the &#8220;OpenScrape&#8221; program,
which is key to this self-sufficiency, will be provided in more detail later in this
document.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   That said, there are a number of places you can find pre-created
maps for use with OpenHoldem. There is a section on the
Wiki(<a 
href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=Table_Maps" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=Table_Maps</span></a>) that
contains user-contributed maps. These maps are likely to be more or less out of date, and
would require some validation to ensure they are 100% correct. Consider these maps to
be a starting point for learning how maps are constructed and how they work. The
forums have a lot of discussion on maps, and you can likely find maps attached to posts;
same caveats apply as to the Wiki maps.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   Most probably you will experience some problems if you fix or create your first map.
Feel welcome to ask for assistance in the forums. There are always some friendly people
