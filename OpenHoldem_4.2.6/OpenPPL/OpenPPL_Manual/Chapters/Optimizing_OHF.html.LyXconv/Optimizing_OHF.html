<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Profiles coded in Shanky-style often contain long repetitive code-sequences and the
converter translates open-ended when-conditions in a not optimal, but easy to translate
way. This might lead to larger than necessary code and for large (Shanky-) profiles to
somewhat slow execution. To overcome these handicaps our member Relhby
developed an optimizer for the generated OH-script-code that replaces repeated
code-snippets by auto-generated functions. It gets executed at the command-line like
below:
   <!--l. 33-->
   <div class="lstlisting" id="listing-1"><span class="label"><a 
 id="x1-1001r1"></a></span>OHF<span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>optimizer.exe&#x00A0;INPUTFILE.OHF&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;OUTPUTFILE.OHF
   </div>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Advantages</h3>
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">The optimized code usually becomes 20-50% smaller, and therefore loads
        faster.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">The  optimized  code  usually  gets  executed  2-10  times  faster  due  to
        OpenHoldems symbol caching.</li></ul>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Disadvantages</h3>
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">For every open-ended when-condition a new function gets introduced with
        an auto-generated name like &#8220;f$OEWC_163&#8221;. This affects the readability
        of your code and especially of your log-files.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Well-structured code with lots of user-defined functions and few repetitive
        code-snippets might even become larger and slower.</li></ul>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>General advide</h3>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >We recommend you to use this tool for original Shanky-style profiles. They do usually
benefit much from this optimization. However for well-structured OpenPPL-profiles with
lots of user-defined functions the disadvantages might predominate. If you are unsure the
file-size before and after optimization will be a good indication. Files that become
smaller did usually benefit.
