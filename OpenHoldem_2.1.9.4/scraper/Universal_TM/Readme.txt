"Universal.tm" is a universal tablemap that accepts every table.
It is meant as a tool to connect to new casinos and shoot replay-frames when you build a new map.

Be careful if you use it and put in into the standard scraper folder: 
the autoconnector will then be willing to connect to any kind of random "table".
