Table Stats
\emph default
: As discussed in the {Calculated Symbols} section, the Table Stats symbols
 (floppct, turnpct, riverpct, avgbetspf and tablepfr) are calculated on
 a rolling time average.
 The time frame (in minutes) specified by this parameter determines how
 far back in time these averages are calculated.
 For example, if this is set to 15 minutes, then the averages will be for
 the last 15 minutes of activity at the table.

handrank
\end_layout

\end_inset

handrank is a calculated symbol, and is set to one of 169, 1000, 1326, 2652
 or p.
 Depending on the option selected here, handrank will be set equal to the
 calculated handrank169, handrank1000, handrank1326, handrank2652 or handrankp
 symbols.
 This setting also determines the hand rank value that is displayed on the
 main window’s status bar (see {Status Bar} for more information).
 See section {Starting Hand } for more information on hand ranks.

Symbol caching

symbol caching
\emph default
: The normal operation for the OpenHoldem parsing and decision engine is
 to cache the results of each symbol that it calculates in a given scrape
 cycle.
 The reason for this, is that if a UDF is referenced 100 times in a given
 function calculation, it makes sense to save the results of the first calculati
on, and then reuse the results in the other 99 references.
 This is just an efficient use of CPU resources.
 By checking this preference, you instruct OpenHoldem to bypass this caching
 and guarantee that each symbol is re-calculated each time it is needed.
 Whether this option is checked or unchecked, dll$ symbols are never cached,
 as if a caching of User DLL symbols is needed, that can easily be accommodated
 in the DLL itself by the DLL developer.
