<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Symbols preferences control various aspects of OpenHoldem&#8217;s calculated symbols. See the
{Calculated SymbolsCreating a Table Map} section for more information.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Time Period to Average Table Stats</span>:  As  discussed  in  the  {Calculated
        Symbols}  section,  the  Table  Stats  symbols  (floppct,  turnpct,  riverpct,
        avgbetspf and tablepfr) are calculated on a rolling time average. The time
        frame (in minutes) specified by this parameter determines how far back
        in time these averages are calculated. For example, if this is set to 15
        minutes, then the averages will be for the last 15 minutes of activity at
        the table.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Value of &#8220;handrank&#8221;</span>: handrank is a calculated symbol, and is set to one
        of 169, 1000, 1326, 2652 or p. Depending on the option selected here,
        handrank will be set equal to the calculated handrank169, handrank1000,
        handrank1326, handrank2652 or handrankp symbols. This setting also
        determines the hand rank value that is displayed on the main window&#8217;s
        status bar (see {Status Bar} for more information). See section {Starting
        Hand } for more information on hand ranks.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Disable all symbol caching</span>: The normal operation for the OpenHoldem
        parsing and decision engine is to cache the results of each symbol that it
        calculates in a given scrape cycle. The reason for this, is that if a UDF is
        referenced 100 times in a given function calculation, it makes sense to save
        the results of the first calculation, and then reuse the results in the other 99
        references. This is just an efficient use of CPU resources. By checking this
        preference, you instruct OpenHoldem to bypass this caching and guarantee
        that each symbol is re-calculated each time it is needed. Whether this
        option is checked or unchecked, dll$ symbols are never cached, as if a
        caching of User DLL symbols is needed, that can easily be accommodated
        in the DLL itself by the DLL developer.</li></ul>
