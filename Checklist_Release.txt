* Have a look at http://code.google.com/p/openholdembot/source/list 
  and ask the developers, if all work is completed and remind them to update the release-notes
* Update the version and release-date in the release-notes "##_OpenHoldem_Release_Directory_##\documents\"OpenHoldem Release Notes.txt""
* Change the version of OpenHoldem
  (search the OpenHoldem-project for the old one, e.g. "4.2.5" and "4.25", but don't auto-replace)
  OpenHoldem\stdaxafx.h
  OpenHoldem\OpenHoldem.rc
* Choose the correct build option 
  - usually optimized for OH, but debug if there are some known problems left
  - release for Perl (necessary!)
  - debug for the rest
* Rebuild everything
* Test "everything", at least briefly that OH "works"
* Commit everything
* Tag the release on googlecode
  TurtoiseSVN -> Branch/Tag
  and then create a tag for svn/tags/OpenHoldem_4.x.y
  Comment: "Tagging OpenHoldem 4.x.y for release"
* Copy the directory "##_OpenHoldem_Release_Directory_##" to desktop and name it "OpenHoldem_x.y.z"
* Copy all executables and DLLs to the new directory
* But remove OpenPPL.exe and all other OpenPPL-files, because this is an independent release
* Add all *.lib-files to support linking
* Add OpenHoldem.pdb if compiled in debug-mode (the other *.pdb-files are usually not necessary)
* Remove the *.exp and unnecessary *.pdb files.
* Add dbdhelp.dll
* Remove replay-direcoty (if existent), logs and other private data
* Create a rar-archive
* Upload the rar-file "OpenHoldem_x.y.z.rar" to google-code.
  Please dont forget Summary and description (release-notes).
  Labels: Featured, Type-Executable, OpSys-Windows
* Remove the label "Featured" from the last release of OpenHoldem
* Announce the new download in "OpenHoldem Stickies" and post the release-notes.
