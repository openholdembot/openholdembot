  OpenHoldem\stdaxafx.h
  OpenHoldem\OpenHoldem.rc
* Choose the correct build option 
  - usually optimized for OH, but debug if there are some known problems left
  - release for Perl (necessary!)
  - debug for the rest
* Rebuild everything
* Test "everything", at least briefly that OH "works"
* Commit everything
* Tag the release on googlecode
