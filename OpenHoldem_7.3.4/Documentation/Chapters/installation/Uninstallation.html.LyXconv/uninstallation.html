<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >We hope you will never have to uninstall OpenHoldem on any of your machines.
However, we often see enthusiastic newbies who download OpenHoldem and naively
install it to their one and only machine without any attempts to stealth it. And
then they ask how they can get their computer clean again - be it that they
failed and want to play manually again or they want to create a clean setup for
production.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Probably it is too late - you have already been flagged by your favourite casino.
Anyway - the &#8220;best&#8221; way to get your PC &#8220;clean&#8221; again without a reinstallation:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Remove the complete installation directory and all other botting-related
        files you may have on your computer: executables, formulae, tablemaps,
        archives, logs, etc.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Delete any desktop icons and delete any startmenu shortcut (if you have
        created them) .
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">OpenHoldem  (version  4.x+)  no  longer  uses  the  registry  to  store
        its   preferences.   However   Windows   stores   some   information   like
        last  recently  used  files.  Take  a  registry-editor  like  regedit.exe  and
        search  for  &#8220;openholdem&#8221;,  &#8220;openscrape&#8221;,  &#8220;manualmode&#8221;,  &#8220;.ohf&#8221;,  &#8220;.tm&#8221;,
        &#8220;maxinmontreal&#8221; and maybe some others.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Wipe your browser cache.</li></ul>
