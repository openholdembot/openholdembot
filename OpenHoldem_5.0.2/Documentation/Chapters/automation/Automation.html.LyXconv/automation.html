<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Alright, so you have made it through the previous sections, and have a working Table
Map, a set of bot logic for your target game, and a fully-stealthed out configuration. You
may have just started to realize what a pain it is to have to manually start the software,
select a table, sit at the table, connect OpenHoldem, leave the table, start a new table,
etc. This becomes even more oppressive if you want to run multiple simultaneous
tables.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   The answer is automation. Automation will do these opening, selecting,
moving, and clicking activities for you, and allow you to ultimately sleep while
your poker bot plays for you. Nothing better than making money while you
sleep!
