           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Change in handnumber: </span>This option will cause OpenHoldem to wait at
        least for a new hand before doing a second rebuy. It is a simply sanity-check
        to prevent too many rebuys, as most casinos will increase your balance
        only after the end of the current hand.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">No cards: </span>This option will prevent rebuys as long as you are involved in
        a hand.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Heuristic   occlusion   check:   </span>Rebuys   are   especially   volatile   against
        misscrapes  of  the  balance,  which  could  be  caused  e.g.  by  temporary
        occlusion (The truths is: OpenHoldem will keep the last known balance, if
        it can&#8217;t scrape the balance correctly. But it&#8217;s always good to have another
        safety-net, isn&#8217;t it?). The option to do heuristic occlusion checks will cause
        OpenHoldem to look at other players names and balances to guess, if heros
        balance is occluded. In case of a probable occlusion the rebuy-process
        won&#8217;t be started. Heuristic occlusion checks will add some extra safety,
        but they won&#8217;t catch every misscrape; e.g. the very unfortunate case of a
        partial occluded, but non-zero balance will still get accepted.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Minimum time to next rebuy:  </span>This  option  is  another  sanity  check  to
        prevent to much rebuys in a short period of time. The time difference gets
        specified in seconds.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span

        when a rebuy is required.</li></ul>
