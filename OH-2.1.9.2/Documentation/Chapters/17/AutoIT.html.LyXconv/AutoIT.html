<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >The general tool of choice for automation is AutoIt (<a 
href="http://autoitscript.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://autoitscript.com</span></a>). AutoIt
is a free (as in beer &#8211; this is not an open source program) Windows scripting language
and execution engine. From the web site: &#8220;AutoIt is a freeware Windows automation
language. It can be used to script most simple Windows-based tasks (great for PC
rollouts or home automation). AutoIt has been in popular use since 1999 and continues
to provide users and administrators with an easy way to script the Windows GUI. In
February 2004 the latest version of AutoIt - known as AutoIt v3 - was released and
added powerful scripting features.&#8221;
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Automation of poker botting is one of those &#8220;simple Windows-based tasks&#8221; that
AutoIt is great for. The challenge is that now you have a new language to learn (does it
ever end?), but the support for AutoIt on their forums is astounding, and you can also
get help on the OpenHoldem forums.
