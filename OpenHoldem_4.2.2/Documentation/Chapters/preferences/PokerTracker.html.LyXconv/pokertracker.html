<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Poker Tracker preferences control how OpenHoldem interacts with a Poker Tracker
database. See the {PokerTracker} section for more information on using Poker Tracker
with OpenHoldem.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Disable all Poker Tracker access</span>: Checking this preference will completely
        disable all Poker Tracker functionality in OpenHoldem. If you make no
        use of any Poker Tracker symbols, then it is safe to check this box.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Poker Tracker version</span>: OpenHoldem supports interacting with both Poker
        Tracker v2 and Poker Tracker v3 databases. This setting will instruct
        OpenHoldem as to which flavor of Poker Tracker you are using.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Host  Name  /  IP  Address,  Port,  Username,  Password,  DB  Name</span>:
        These  are  the  parameters  that  you  entered  when  you  setup  your
        Poker Tracker PostgreSQL database. Enter them here so OpenHoldem
        knows  how  to  connect  to  your  database.  If  you  do  not  understand
        what these settings mean, please refer to the Poker Tracker homepage
        (<a 
href="http://www.pokertracker.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.pokertracker.com</span></a>) for more information.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Update delay</span>: OpenHoldem maintains an internal cache of Poker Tracker
        statistics that it periodically queries from the Poker Tracker database.
        This  setting  determines  the  frequency  that  OpenHoldem  will  use  (in
        seconds) to consider re-querying those statistics. This setting is akin to the
        &#8220;Scrape Delay&#8221; setting in the Scraper preferences for the screen scraper
        engine. This parameter does not need to be a particularly small value,
        as the information in Poker Tracker does not change that often itself.
        Note: Just because this delay has expired, and the Poker Tracker query
        engine &#8220;wakes up&#8221;, does not guarantee that every statistic will be updated.
        Rather, this works in conjunction with the &#8220;Cache refresh&#8221;  parameter
        below to decide if a statistic needs updating or not.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Cache refresh</span>: After the Poker Tracker query engine has been &#8220;woken
        up&#8221;, because the delay specified in the &#8220;Update delay&#8221;  parameter has
        expired, the engine will scan through each of its statistics for every chair
        and determine if that statistic needs updating or not. If the duration
        between now and the last time that a given statistic was retrieved from
        Poker Tracker is greater than this parameter (in seconds), then the engine
        considers the statistic to be stale and will query Poker Tracker for a new
        value.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Test</span>: This button will test the connection to the Poker Tracker database
        as specified by the above parameters and will report success or failure
        codes. Help with connecting to PostgreSQL databases can be found here:
        http://www.pokertracker.com, or here: http://www.postgresql.org</li></ul>
