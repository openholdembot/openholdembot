<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Before you try to configure OpenHoldem to work with a Poker Tracker database, you
must have a properly working Poker Tracker configuration set up first. This is not the
most trivial of activities, and does have a learning curve. The best information
on how to set up Poker Tracker can be found on the Poker Tracker website
(<a 
href="http://www.pokertracker.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.pokertracker.com</span></a>).
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Assuming you have a working Poker Tracker installation, let&#8217;s move on to getting
OpenHoldem to work with your Poker Tracker database. OpenHoldem only works with
PostgreSQL databases, not with Access databases; so if you do not have Poker Tracker
configured in that way (and you know if you do), go back and get that set up
first.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   OK, so now you have Poker Tracker installed using PostgreSQL as the underlying
database. Do you have Poker Tracker setup to automatically import hand histories into
your database? If not, OpenHoldem will not be able to provide you any useful
information, as there will be no information in your database to pull from. Learn how to
automatically import hand histories here: http://www.pokertracker.com
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   After all of that is configured, you can use the settings in {Preferences} to instruct
OpenHoldem how to connect to your Poker Tracker database.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   When connected, OpenHoldem will query the database using the sitename
and playername as key parameters for the query and return stats ...symbols
...reference!!!
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.2"></a>Sitename </h3>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Everything in Poker Tracker is first organized by what it calls a &#8220;site id&#8221;. When
querying the database, the first thing OpenHoldem will try to do is associate
your sitename or network, as specified in the Table Map, to a Poker Tracker
&#8220;site id&#8221;. This is done by doing a case-insensitive substring lookup against the
following lists. This means that if your sitename string is &#8220;stars10sng&#8221; it will
still be able to associate that to the proper &#8220;site id&#8221;, as &#8220;stars&#8221; is within that
sitename.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   If one of the below character strings cannot be found in either the sitename or
network strings, as specified in your Table Map file, using a case-insensitive substring
search, then OpenHoldem will not be able to lookup statistics for the players playing at
your table.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   As a note, the sitename string is searched first, and if a match cannot be found there,
then the network string is searched.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-60001.3"></a>Playername </h3>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The second critical piece of information that OpenHoldem needs to query the database is
the name of the player. OpenHoldem gets this from the pXname/uXname regions on the
Table Map. Note that this scraped name does not need to exactly match the name as
stored in the database. This is useful, as there is currently no method for scraping spaces
in players&#8217; names. OpenHoldem will in all cases, return the statistics for an exact name
match if it exists, and if it does not exist, will find the closest match using a Levenshtein
distance algorithm (<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance</span></a>). Note
that Levenshtein distances that exceed one-half the length of the name as stored in Poker
Tracker are discarded as invalid.
