            <ul class="itemize2">
            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Manual  choice:  </span>The  classical  method.  If  exactly  one  table  and
            exactly one matching tablemap exist OpenHoldem will connect to
            that table directly, otherwise it will present a dialog with a list of
            choices for manual selection. This behaviour was quite inconvenient
            in production, but is still supported for backward compatibility.
            </li>
            <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Automatical choice: </span>This option will pick the first available table on
            every attempt to connect, that is not yet attached to another instance
            of OpenHoldem. If no such table is available, it will fall silently. If
            multiple tablemaps in the scraper-folder fit to that table it will also
            pick the &#8220;first&#8221; one, so be careful, if you want to keep different versions
            of the same map.</li></ul>
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Auto-connect on start: </span>This setting is pretty self-explanatory. OpenHolden will
        try to connect once to a table at startup. This setting is especially useful in
        combination with the option to automatically choose a table. If no table exists,
        that fits to a tablemap &#8211; or if all such tables are already getting served &#8211;
        OpenHoldem will skip the connection and start normally; in this case you can
        connect OpenHoldem later, either by pressing the greeen button or by sending
        a connect-message.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Close OH when table disappears: </span>This option will terminate OpenHoldem, when
        the poker table stops to exist, e.g. when the table got closed by the hopper or
        when you get moved to another table in a MTT. This method is for you, if your
        philosophy to do reconnects is to close OpenHoldem and to simply fire up
        another instance. The other way to do reconnects would be to not close
        OpenHoldem and to connect it again, when the -&#x003E;hopper opens a new table
        (either by pushing the green button or using -&#x003E;connect by HWND) (Fully
        automated reconnects are not implemented; they would cause a too high
        CPU-load (currently each attempt to connect has to load every single
        tablemap), they would therefore require lots of refactoring and could
        thus become the source of many subtle mistakes in a multi-threaded
        environment. Therefore we decided against that feature. This is no loss,
        as there are at least three other ways to do reconnects as described
        above.).</li></ul>
