<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >This is a guide to show you how to get OpenHoldem running securely on a single
computer using the VMware Server application as a second, "virtual" computer. Original
post by Tammelinn: <a 
href="http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894</span></a>
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   The guide assumes no special knowledge, but you will need some basic computer
skills. You will need to know how to install software, how to rename files, how to
navigate folders and so on.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   I am also assuming that you are using the same operating system as me. If you are
using Windows XP Media Centre Edition or Windows XP Professional, you
can use this guide. If you are using some other brand of Windows (including
Vista), the guide might not be reliable. I have only tested these instructions with
XP.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Much of this information is already available elsewhere. In many cases, all I have
done is to reword it a little.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-20000.1.1"></a>Definitions </h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >The "real" computer is the one that is sitting on your desk or on your lap. It has its own
operating system. The "virtual" computer is the one we are going to create using
VMware Server. We can think of the "virtual" computer as a separate computer
with its own operating system, even though it is physically part of the "real"
computer.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30000.1.2"></a>Step 1 - Download VMware Server </h4>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >VMware Server is a free download from <a 
href="http://www.vmware.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.vmware.com</span></a>. You will need to
provide VMware with a valid e-mail address to get a serial number. I used version 1.0.3
while writing this guide.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   You will also need a Windows installation disk. I am using a Windows XP
Professional installation DVD, which I&#8217;m going to install as my "virtual" operating
system.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   While you wait for the download to finish, you should read the whole of this guide
and make sure that you understand it. It would be a good idea to print it out, if you
can.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   DO NOT INSTALL ANY SOFTWARE until you are told to.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-40000.1.3"></a>Step 2 - Install VMware Server on your real computer </h4>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Double-click on the VMware Server file you downloaded and it will begin installing itself.
When you are asked if you want a "complete" or "custom" installation, choose
"complete". A big window with some warnings about "IIS" might appear. We
don&#8217;t need IIS, so just click &#8220;OK&#8221;. When the installer asks for Internet access,
grant it. Wait for the installation to complete before moving on to the next
step.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.4. </span> <a 
 id="x1-50000.1.4"></a>Step 3 - Configure VMware Player </h4>
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Double-click on the "VMware Server" icon that should have appeared on the desktop of
your real computer. VMware Server will start for the first time. A Pop-up window asks
you to choose between a local host and a remote host. Choose "local host" and click
"OK".
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Click the "New Virtual Machine" icon and a window will appear. Choose "typical"
and click "next". Now choose which operating system you want to install on your virtual
computer. Here, I selected the "Microsoft Windows" option, and the version I selected
was "Windows XP, Professional".
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The next window gives you two boxes to fill in. The first box gives you a chance to
name your new virtual computer. Choose any name you like.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   The second box ("Location") allows you to choose where the Virtual computer will
be saved on your hard drive. You probably don&#8217;t need to change the contents of this box.
(The virtual computer is actually a single file which exists on the hard drive of your real
computer. If you want this file to be in a different folder or even on a different partition,
you can tell VMware now.)
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   Next you must choose the type of network. Choose "Use bridged networking".
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   The next window asks you to decide how big the virtual computer&#8217;s virtual hard
drive is going to be. The suggested 8GB is quite enough for the purposes of playing
poker. Click "Finish" when you are ready.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   VMware will spend quite a few minutes creating the virtual computer.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.5. </span> <a 
 id="x1-60000.1.5"></a>Step 4 - Install an operating system on the virtual computer</h4>
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >When VMware is ready, you&#8217;ll see a new window with some details about the virtual
computer. Find "Start this virtual machine" on the left and click it. VMware will
now look for the Windows installation disk in your CD/DVD drive. Put the
installation disk in the drive and Windows will begin installing onto your virtual
computer.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Soon, Windows will ask you if you want to format your hard drive. Only the
virtual hard drive of the virtual computer is going to get formatted, so you
don&#8217;t need to worry about the data on your real hard drive. It is perfectly safe.
If you asked how you want to format the virtual hard drive, make sure you
choose one of the NTFS options. (Do not choose any option with FAT16 or
FAT32).
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   Eventually, Windows will ask you to enter your full name. We are going
to create three seperate users, so choose a name for the first user ("Jessica",
for example) and enter it here. This user will have permanent administrator
privileges.
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   Next, enter an administrator password for this user. Write down the name and
password now.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   ADMINISTRATOR NAME AND PASSWORD _________________________
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Later, Windows will ask you to enter up to five user names. The first user - the box
labelled "your name" - should be the same as the user you entered above ("Jessica").
Don&#8217;t fill in the other boxes yet.
<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >   Wait until the installation is complete. You should be looking at a brand-new
installation of Windows XP. If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games
- Solitaire") then you are ready to move on to the next step.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.6. </span> <a 
 id="x1-70000.1.6"></a>Step 5 - Install VMTools, Firewall and Antivirus on virtual computer
</h4>
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >VMTools is a package which, among other things, gets the mouse to move smoothly
between the real and the virtual computer. You need to install it now, so press
CTRL+ALT to restore mouse control to the real computer. Then, on the VMware Server
window, click on the menu option VM, and then choose "Install VMTools..." VMTools
will now install itself inside the virtual computer. The virtual computer will need to
reboot.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >   After the reboot, find the VMTools icon in the system tray, next to the clock. It
looks like three small interlinked squares. When you have found it, double-click on
it.
<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   A window appears and the "Options" tab is already showing. Find the line "Show
VMware Tools in the taskbar" and click on it, so that there is no longer a tick next to
it. Click &#8220;OK&#8221; to save your changes. This measure prevents the casino from
seeing that you&#8217;re using VMware - just in case they take a screenshot of your
desktop.
<!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   Now, your virtual computer is connected to the Internet, so it needs firewall software
and antivirus software, just as your real computer does. Install the software (connect to
the Internet to download it, if you have to), and then run a scan to check that your
virtual computer is free from viruses.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   (You could use AVG Antivirus (<a 
href="http://free.grisoft.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://free.grisoft.com</span></a>), and Zonealarm
Firewall (<a 
href="http://www.zonealarm.com" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1000">http://www.zonealarm.com</span></a>))
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.7. </span> <a 
 id="x1-80000.1.7"></a>Step 6 - Check that the real and virtual computers can communicate</h4>
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >If the real computer and the virtual computer can&#8217;t communicate with each other, all
your efforts in securing them will be wasted. Let&#8217;s check the communications
now.
<!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   The traditional way to test a network is to have one computer "ping" the other. A
ping is a short signal which one computer sends to another. The signal will get bounced
back if the network is running as it should.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   Before pinging anything, you need to turn off the firewalls on both computers. If you
have installed a firewall such as Zonealarm, switch it off. Now click "Start - Control
Panel - Security Centre". At the bottom of the window is an option to "Manage security
settings for: Windows Firewall". Click on "Windows Firewall" and make sure it is off. Do
this on both computers.
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   Now you need to find out the IP address for both computers. (An IP address is a
numerical address which computers on a network use to identify each other.)
<!--l. 210--><p class="indent" >   On your real computer, click "Start - Run". Type "cmd" in the box and press
return.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   A new window appears. Type &#8220;ipconfig" and press return. You will see a
series of numbers, some of which are marked "IP address". Find the one that
corresponds to the type of Internet connection you have - for example, the one
labeled "wireless connection" if you connect to the Internet through a wireless
router.
<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >   The IP address of my real computer is 192.168.1.4 - yours probably looks almost the
same. Write it down now.
<!--l. 223--><p class="indent" >   REAL COMPUTER IP ADDRESS _________________________
<!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   Now do the same thing on your virtual computer. Find the IP address and write it

down. The IP address of my virtual computer is 192.168.1.7 - yours will be
similar.
<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >   VIRTUAL COMPUTER IP ADDRESS _________________________
<!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   On your real computer, find the new window again and type "ping x.x.x.x", then
press return. Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of your virtual computer. You should
see something like this...
<!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >   Pinging 192.168.1.7 with 32 bytes of data:
<!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >   Reply from 192.168.1.7: bytes=32 time&#x003C;1ms TTL=128 Reply from 192.168.1.7:
bytes=32 time&#x003C;1ms TTL=128 Reply from 192.168.1.7: bytes=32 time&#x003C;1ms TTL=128
Reply from 192.168.1.7: bytes=32 time&#x003C;1ms TTL=128
<!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >   Ping statistics for 192.168.1.7: (and so on)
<!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >   This dialogue means that the real computer sent a signal to the virtual computer
four times, and each time it got a response.
<!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >   If the network isn&#8217;t set up properly, you will see something like this...
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   Pinging 192.168.1.7 with 32 bytes of data:
<!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >   Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed out. Request timed
out.
<!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >   Ping statistics for 192.168.1.7: (and so on)
<!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >   This dialogue means that the real computer sent a signal to the virtual computer
four times, but received no response.
<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >   Go to your virtual computer and do the same thing. This time, type "ping x.x.x.x"
replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address of your real computer. If you get a response,
your network is set up properly and you can continue to the next step. If the
network isn&#8217;t set up properly, you should seek help from someone who understands
networks.
<!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >   Don&#8217;t forget to TURN YOUR FIREWALLS BACK ON AGAIN when you finish this
step. If you have a good firewall such as Zonealarm, you can leave the less powerful
Windows firewall turned off permanently (on your real computer as well as your virtual
computer).
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.8. </span> <a 
 id="x1-90000.1.8"></a>Step 7 - Set up user accounts on virtual computer </h4>
<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >Click "Start - Control Panel - User Accounts".
<!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >   You had already set up one user while installing Windows. This user already has
admin privileges. We&#8217;ll call it the "admin" user. We need to give this user a password. It
can be the same password you used in step 4. Click on the user, then click on "create a
password". Enter the password into the boxes and click on "create password". The next
window asks you if you want to make your files and folders private. You certainly do,
so click "Yes, make private". Click on "Back" to return to the user accounts
window.
<!--l. 288--><p class="indent" >   Now we&#8217;ll set up two new users with fewer privileges. You will be logged in as the
second user whenever you connect to a casino. We&#8217;ll call this the "casino" user. The third
user will be created to hide things from the casino. We&#8217;ll call this the "stealth"
user.
<!--l. 294--><p class="indent" >   Choose names and passwords for these users, and write them all down
now.
<!--l. 297--><p class="indent" >   ADMIN USER _________________________ CASINO
USER _________________________ STEALTH USER
_________________________

<!--l. 301--><p class="indent" >   The casino user will have restricted privileges initially. Click "create a new account",
enter the name of the casino user and click "next". Click on "limited" and then click on
"create account". The casino user will appear next to the admin user. Click on the casino
user and give it a password.
<!--l. 308--><p class="indent" >   The stealth user will have restricted privileges permanently. Click "create a new
account" and set up the stealth user in the same way you set up the casino
user.
<!--l. 312--><p class="indent" >   Click "create a new account". Choose a name and then click on "limited
account".
<!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >   That completes this step. If there is a "guest" user shown, you can ignore it. Close
the "user accounts" window.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.9. </span> <a 
 id="x1-100000.1.9"></a>Step 8 - Create a protected folder on virtual computer </h4>
<!--l. 322--><p class="noindent" >You should still be logged in as the admin user. Stay logged in as this user throughout
step 8.
<!--l. 325--><p class="indent" >   We need to create a folder to hide some sensitive information. The best place for this
folder is inside the root folder (click Start - My Computer - Local Disk C:. Then click on
"show contents of this folder").
<!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >   Create a new folder in this window and give it an innocent name. ("Files" would
be a good name.) From now on, this folder will be referred to as the "Ninja"
folder.
<!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >   Click "Start - Control Panel - (Appearances and Themes) - Folder Options". Click
the "View" tab. In the "Advanced Settings" window, find the line "Use simple file
sharing (recommended)". If there is a green tick on this line, click on it to remove it.
Click on the big "OK" button to save your changes.
<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   Now, right click on the Ninja folder and choose "Properties". Click on the "Security"
tab. In the "Group or user names" box you will see a list of users, but the stealth user
should not be one of them.
<!--l. 346--><p class="indent" >   We want to change the folder&#8217;s settings so that the stealth user is the only user who
can see inside it. (Not even users with admin privileges should be able to see inside.)
Click the &#8220;Add" button. In the "Enter the object names to select" box, type in the name
of the stealth user (for example, my stealth user is called James). Click the "OK" button.
There should now be a new entry in the list. My stealth user shows up as &#8220;James
(XPPRO/James)" in that list.
<!--l. 356--><p class="indent" >   Now we need to remove every user except the stealth user from the list. Click the
"Advanced" button. Find the line which says "Inherit from parent the permission
entries..." and click on it. A warning pop-up appears; click on the "Remove" button. The
line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." should no longer have a
tick next to it. Click the &#8220;OK&#8221; button. Another warning pop-up might appear. If it does,
click "Remove", then &#8220;OK&#8221;. The list of users should now have only one user in it, the
stealth user.
<!--l. 367--><p class="indent" >   Find the "Full control" line. In the "allow" column, there is a small box. Click on it,
and a column full of ticks will appear. If everything has gone to plan, there will be one
user with full control over the Ninja folder. If you&#8217;re happy, click "OK". If something
seems to be wrong, click "Cancel" and go through the last two paragraphs
again.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.10. </span> <a 
 id="x1-110000.1.10"></a>Step 9 - Take charge of the protected folder</h4>
<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent" >Log out from the admin user account and login as the stealth user (click Start - Log off -
Switch User). Go to "My Computer" again and find the Ninja folder. Right click on the
folder and choose "Properties". Click on the "Security" tab. Check that the stealth user
is still the only user in the list.
<!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >   Click the "Advanced" button and click the "Owner" tab. Left click once on the
stealth user so that it changes colour to blue. Find the "Replace owner..." line and click
on it, so that a green tick appears next to it. Then click on "Apply".
<!--l. 389--><p class="indent" >   The user in the box "Current owner of this item" should have changed to the stealth
user.
<!--l. 392--><p class="indent" >   Now click on the "Permissions" tab. Find the "Inherit from the parent
permission entries..." line; there should still be no tick next to it. Just below, find
the "Replace permission entries on all child objects..." line; click on it so that
there is a green tick next to it. Click the "Apply" button. A warning pop-up
appears; click the "Yes" button. Click on the &#8220;OK&#8221; buttons twice to save your
changes.
<!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s check that everything is set up correctly. The stealth user is the only one who
should be able to see the Ninja folder and ANYTHING it contains.
<!--l. 405--><p class="indent" >   Open the Ninja folder (by double clicking on it) and create a folder called "test"
inside it. Right click on the "test" folder, choose "Properties" and click on the "Security"
tab. If the stealth user is the only person in the list, everything is as it should
be.
<!--l. 412--><p class="indent" >   Close all the windows and log out from the stealth user account.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.11. </span> <a 
 id="x1-120000.1.11"></a>Step 10 - One more check </h4>
<!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >Log in as the admin user. Find the Ninja folder, and try to look inside it. Your attempt
to see inside this protected folder should be denied. When you run casino software, it will
not be able to see inside this folder (unless it tries to take ownership of the folder - but
this would be a CRIMINAL act.)
<!--l. 423--><p class="indent" >   This setup is not 100% secure, but it is probably secure enough.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.12. </span> <a 
 id="x1-130000.1.12"></a>Step 11 - Install Bring on your virtual computer</h4>
<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >You now have a real computer and a virtual computer. OpenHoldem is going to
run on the real computer. The casino software is going to run on the virtual
computer.
<!--l. 432--><p class="indent" >   Now you need to install some software that will allow OpenHoldem (on the real
computer) to see what the casino software (on the virtual computer) is doing. There
are several ways of doing this. We are going to use a piece of software called
"Bring".
<!--l. 437--><p class="indent" >   On the virtual computer, log in as the stealth user. Now go to the official
WinHoldem site (See {Bring}) and download "bring.exe" (from the "stealth" page).
Download it directly into the Ninja folder.
<!--l. 442--><p class="indent" >   The casino software can&#8217;t see inside the Ninja folder, but it will be able to
see Bring being run as a process. (If you want to see all the processes your
computer is running, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then click on the "processes"
tab.)
<!--l. 447--><p class="indent" >   The solution is to rename Bring to something more innocent. Then, if the casino

software looks at the processes you are running, it won&#8217;t be able to find out anything
incriminating about Bring.
<!--l. 451--><p class="indent" >   Rename Bring now. For example, you could rename it to "notepad" or
&#8220;paint".
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.13. </span> <a 
 id="x1-140000.1.13"></a>Step 12 - Install software on your real computer</h4>
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >You can now install Bring on your real computer. You don&#8217;t need to rename it; the
casino cannot see what is happening on your real computer.
<!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >   Open a folder on the desktop, call it "Bring", and download into it the files
"bring.exe" and &#8220;bring.ini".
<!--l. 464--><p class="indent" >   Click "Start - Control Panel - Folder Options". Click the "View" tab. In the box
labeled "Advanced Settings", scroll down and find the line "Hide extensions for known
file types". If there is a green tick next to this line, click on it to make the tick disappear.
Click "OK&#8221; to save your changes.
<!--l. 472--><p class="indent" >   You should also install OpenHoldem on your real computer now if you haven&#8217;t
already. DO NOT INSTALL OH ON YOUR VIRTUAL COMPUTER.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.14. </span> <a 
 id="x1-150000.1.14"></a>Step 13 - Configure Bring </h4>
<!--l. 478--><p class="noindent" >Do you remember the IP address of your virtual computer? You&#8217;re going to need it again
now.
<!--l. 481--><p class="indent" >   On your real computer, go into the "Bring" folder you just created and open the file
"bring.ini" in a text editor. (Right-click on &#8220;bring.ini&#8221;, choose "Open with..." and select
"Notepad".)
<!--l. 486--><p class="indent" >   Find the following lines:

<!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >Now we&#8217;re going to test Bring by playing a game of solitaire on the virtual computer,
and by attempting to control it from the real computer.
<!--l. 516--><p class="indent" >   Go to the virtual computer. You should still be logged in as the stealth user. Start
the Solitaire programme ("Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire").
<!--l. 520--><p class="indent" >   Now open another command prompt (click "Start - Run", type "cmd" and press
enter).
<!--l. 523--><p class="indent" >   The command prompt window is currently looking at the "My Documents" folder.
You need to move into the Ninja folder. If you followed the earlier suggestion, the

location of your Ninja folder will be "C:\files". To move into this folder, simply type
&#8220;CD C:\files" and press return. (If this doesn&#8217;t work you will need to learn
how to use the command prompt. Do an Internet search for "DOS command
prompt".)
<!--l. 532--><p class="indent" >   Now type the following command and press return. Instead of bring, you should type
the name of your renamed file. Instead of 80, you should type the port number you chose
in the previous step, and instead of "secret" you should type the password you
chose.
<!--l. 538--><p class="indent" >   bring -s 80 secret
<!--l. 540--><p class="indent" >   A small pop-up will appear to show you that Bring has started on your virtual
computer. Click "OK".
<!--l. 543--><p class="indent" >   Now go to your real computer. Go into the Bring folder and double click on
"bring.exe".
<!--l. 546--><p class="indent" >   Another pop-up appears to show you that Bring has started on your real computer.
Click &#8220;OK&#8221;.
<!--l. 549--><p class="indent" >   Another window appears labeled "Select remote connection". You should see a line
that looks exactly like the line you entered in the "bring.ini" file.
<!--l. 553--><p class="indent" >   a 192.168.1.7 80 secret
<!--l. 555--><p class="indent" >   Click on this line so that it turns blue, and click the "OK" button.
<!--l. 558--><p class="indent" >   Another window appears with a list of programs that are currently running on your
virtual computer. One of them should be solitaire, so click on it so that it turns blue and
then click the "OK" button. Solitaire will launch on your real computer, and if
everything is set up correctly, you will be able to play it and watch your mouse clicks
affecting both computers at once!
<!--l. 565--><p class="indent" >   If you are unable to control solitaire from your real computer you definitely won&#8217;t be
able to control a poker table. Before you continue, seek help from someone who
understands networks.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.16. </span> <a 
 id="x1-170000.1.16"></a>Step 15 - Stop running Bring </h4>
<!--l. 572--><p class="noindent" >When you have had enough of playing solitaire, you should shut down Bring.
<!--l. 575--><p class="indent" >   On the real computer, just close the solitaire window.
<!--l. 577--><p class="indent" >   On the virtual computer, there are three ways to stop Bring.
<!--l. 579--><p class="indent" >   1. Log off
<!--l. 581--><p class="indent" >   2. Stop the Bring process. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL. Two task manager windows will
appear, one for the real computer and one for the virtual computer. Find the task
manager on the virtual computer and click the "Processes" tab, find &#8220;bring.exe"
(however you renamed it), click on it to turn it blue, and then click on "End
Process".
<!--l. 588--><p class="indent" >   3. Lock the desktop. This doesn&#8217;t actually close Bring, but it does halt it and
prevent your real computer from communicating with it.
<!--l. 591--><p class="indent" >   Stop Bring on both computers before you move on to the next step.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">0.1.17. </span> <a 
 id="x1-180000.1.17"></a>Step 16 - Set up the "run as a different user" facility </h4>
<!--l. 597--><p class="noindent" >When you connect to the casino&#8217;s Internet site you should always be logged into your
virtual computer as the casino user. However, you will be running Bring AS IF you will
logged on as the stealth user. In this way, the casino won&#8217;t be able to detect that you are
using Bring. Here&#8217;s how to do it.

<!--l. 603--><p class="indent" >   On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user. Right-click on the desktop and
choose "New", then choose "Shortcut". A window will appear. In the box, type "cmd".
Click "Next" and then click "Finish".
<!--l. 609--><p class="indent" >   A new icon, &#8220;cmd.exe", will have appeared on your desktop. It&#8217;s actually a shortcut
to the command prompt that you have used a few times before. Right-click on this
shortcut and choose "Properties". A window appears and the "Shortcut" tab should
already be showing. Click the "Advanced" button. Find the line which reads "Run with
different credentials". Click on it so that a tick appears next to it. Click the "OK"
buttons twice. "Run with different credentials" actually means "run this program as a
different user".
<!--l. 620--><p class="indent" >   Start solitaire again. Double click the &#8220;cmd.exe" shortcut and a window will appear,
asking you which user you want to use to run the program. Click on the line "The
following user". Then, enter the stealth user&#8217;s name and password, and click
&#8220;OK".
<!--l. 626--><p class="indent" >   The command prompt window appears. It is running as if you were logged in as the
stealth user. We can safely run Bring from this window. Go into the Ninja folder
(perhaps by typing "CD C:\files&#8221;). Type the following command, changing the words
"bring", "80" and "secret" exactly as you did in step 14.
<!--l. 633--><p class="indent" >   bring -s 80 secret
<!--l. 635--><p class="indent" >   Bring&#8217;s pop-up window appears, so click the &#8220;OK&#8221; button.
<!--l. 638--><p class="indent" >   Now go to the real computer and start Bring there. Try to open the solitaire window,
just as you did before.
<!--l. 641--><p class="indent" >   Go back to the virtual computer. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to make the task
manager appear in both windows. Find the virtual computer&#8217;s task manager and
select the "Properties" tab. Check that "bring.exe" (however you renamed it) is
running under the stealth user, even though you are logged in as the casino
user. Check that "sol.exe" - the solitaire process - is running under the casino
user.

<!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" >We&#8217;re going to make one more security check using the program Gaze.
It can be downloaded from the forums at the WinHoldem official site.
(http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=1114)
<!--l. 656--><p class="indent" >   Still on the virtual computer and still logged in as the casino user, go to the
WinHoldem site. There should be two files - "gaze.cpp" and &#8220;gaze.exe". Download both
of them to the virtual computer&#8217;s desktop.
<!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >   Double click on &#8220;gaze.exe&#8221; to run it. A window will appear, and shortly afterwards a
pop-up labeled "Windows - no disk" will appear. Click the "Cancel" button, and close
the Gaze window.
<!--l. 667--><p class="indent" >   The results of the test have been saved to a file on the desktop called "gaze&#8221;.
Confusingly, there are now two text files on the desktop with the same name. Double
click one of them to open it in a text editor. If the first few lines don&#8217;t look like this,
you&#8217;ve got the wrong file.

 id="x1-200000.1.19"></a>Step 18 - Install the casino software </h4>
<!--l. 704--><p class="noindent" >You can now install the casino software. On the virtual computer, log in as the casino
user. Create a new folder on the desktop called "poker". It&#8217;s a good idea to install all
your casino software in a single folder.
<!--l. 709--><p class="indent" >   The casino user currently has restricted privileges. Some casinos insist that you
install their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Some
casinos also insist that you run their software when logged in as a user with
administrative privileges. Preferably, we would like to install and run the software while
logged in as a user has restricted privileges.
<!--l. 716--><p class="indent" >   Here is how to set up a typical casino&#8217;s poker software.
<!--l. 718--><p class="indent" >   Still logged in as the casino user, go to the casino web site. Download their software
directly into the poker folder you created moments ago. Go into the folder and double
click on the software. It will begin installing. When the install asks where you would like
to install the software, choose the "poker" folder you created moments ago. Don&#8217;t let the
install the use the default folder.
<!--l. 726--><p class="indent" >   If the installation completes without complaints, all is well. However, if the
installation complaints that it needs administrative privileges, this is what you must
do:
<!--l. 730--><p class="indent" >   Log out from the casino user&#8217;s account and log in to the admin user&#8217;s account. Open
the "User Accounts" window just as you did before. Click on the casino user act and
then click on "Change the account type". Click on "Computer Administrator" and then
click the "Change Account Type" button. Log out from the admin user&#8217;s account and log
back into the casino user&#8217;s account.
<!--l. 739--><p class="indent" >   Try to install the software again. This time it should install without complaints. Now
log out of the casino user&#8217;s account and go back to the admin user account. Change the
casino user&#8217;s account type back to "limited". Log out of the admin user account and log
back into the casino user&#8217;s account.
<!--l. 745--><p class="indent" >   Now try running the software. If the software complaints that it needs administrative
privileges to run, change the casino user&#8217;s account to "Computer Administrator" just as
you did above. It&#8217;s unfortunate that you have to run the software with administrative
privileges, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world.
