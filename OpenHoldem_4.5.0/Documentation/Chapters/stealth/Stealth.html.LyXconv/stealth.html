<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >An important consideration for any botter is that of stealth. Many casinos will attempt
to detect the OpenHoldem software on your computer, and will either warn you or seize
your account&#8217;s funds if they find it. There are two general approaches to addressing this
problem, a &#8220;Single System&#8221; solution and a &#8220;Dual System&#8221; solution. OpenHoldem provides
a number of facilities for achieving both of these setups and obscuring the program from
detection.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Note that a &#8220;System&#8221; as discussed in this chapter can refer to a physical machine or
a virtual machine. VMware Workstation is a popular choice for consumer system
virtualization, but certainly you can make use of the other consumer virtualization
products available, such as VirutalPC or VirtualBox. Addtionally, dasta center-class,
bare metal hypervisor products such as VMWare ESX or Citrix XEN will work fine as
well. See the {VMWare} section for information on configuring VMWare Workstation.
Configuration of other virtualization platforms is not discussed in this documentation.
