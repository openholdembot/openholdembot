<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   This article explains the basic steps for creating a windows folder that will be as
secure as it can possibly be under the NTFS file system.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The general goal is to create a folder that is owned by a single windows user account
such that no other user account may access the folder - not even the system or the admin
account.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Prerequisites:
           <ol  class="enumerate1" >
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">knowledge of creating/modifying user account
           </li>

           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1006x3">knowledge of NTFS permissions</li></ol>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >It is assumed that the reader understands how to create/modify a user account and how
to use Windows Explorer to navigate folder space and how to modify folder
properties/permissions.

        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1008x1">Login to your admin account
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1010x2">Create/decide target account (from admin account). This account will
        own the hyper-safe folder. For the purpose of this example, the account
        name "ninja" will be used. The "ninja" account must meet the following
        requirements:
        <!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >
            <ol  class="enumerate2" >
            <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1012x1">it cannot be the Administrator account
            </li>
            <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1014x2">it cannot be part of the Administrator group
            </li>
            <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1016x3">it cannot be part of any group except the default users group.</li></ol>
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1018x3">If you need/want to create a special "ninja" account then do that first
        according to the restrictions above. If the account already exists then make sure
        it meets the requirements above.
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1020x4">Create the target folder (from admin account). Your goal here is to
        create/decide the target folder. In an ideal world you would create a top
        level folder on an empty local (non-shared/not-networked) hard drive
        where "ninja" has full control over that disk. If this is not possible
        then the next best thing is a top level folder on a non-shared drive. If
        this is not possible then you must select a location where "ninja"
        will have access to the parent folder so that it can access its private
        folder.

            <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1024x1">Select the properties for the folder and select the security tab add
            "ninja" to the access list and grant "ninja" full control. Remove all
            other users/groups from the access list, which will effectively shut out
            the entire world. There should be exactly one account in the access
            list and that account should be &#8220;&#x003C;host&#x003E;/ninja"

  class="enumerate" id="x1-1026x2">Uncheck/unselect  "Allow  inheritable  permissions  from  parent  to
            propagate to this object". The reason for this is that you want this
            folder and it&#8217;s permissions to be the root node for all children below
            it. If you do not do this then permissions defined for the parent above
            your root folder will filter down to your folder and the children in
            your folder and you do not want that. Note that you cannot give
            ownership of objects in NTFS, you can only "take" ownership with
            the account you&#8217;re currently using. You will take ownership of the
            folder later when you login to the "ninja" account.</li></ol>

        contents of the folder nor modify the folder properties/permissions. As an
        admin you can still take ownership of the folder but until then the admin access
        is denied.</li></ol>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Other thoughts</h4>
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >If you have the resources and you want the best possible solution then you should
dedicate an entire physical hard drive to your stealth department. That drive should not
be the bootable system drive, but should be a secondary drive. You should consume all 4
primary partitions on your stealth drive by creating 4 primary partitions of roughly
equal size. Each partition should be formatted with NTFS only (not FAT or
FAT32).
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   You should then make the "ninja" account the owner of all 4 partitions and the sole
account with access. There should be no other accounts listed in the access list. The
drives should not be networked or shared. If you do this you will notice that your admin
account cannot even read the device label and that the 4 hard drives will be seen
only as "local-drive". All access from any accounts other than "ninja" will be
denied.
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   The benefit of this setup is that once you construct a hard drive like this
you don&#8217;t have to worry about permissions ever again in the context of that
drive - you know that anything you do on that drive must be done from the
"ninja" account and that any folder/files created on that drive are entirely safe.
