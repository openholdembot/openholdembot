<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   The MyHand-symbols originally have been developed by Winngy for a
fixed-limit-bot (playing $5/$10) and later contributed to OpenHoldem. Basically, the
mh_str-symbols (e.g. mh_str_twopair) return a relative ranking of your hand (hole and
common) from 1 to 5, but they can be discounted up to 3 points depending on the
board-texture.
