v1.0.1 2012-xx-yy
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- Automatic betsize-adjustmeant could lead to minraises
  even if we didn't want to raise. Thanks to Postenjak for reporting. 
  [THF]
- HaveTwoPair didn't work. Ace gets set twice in rankbits, 
  as high (bit 14 = ace) and as low (bit 1). This got counted as two pairs.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_LowestBitOfRankBitsCommon did a bit-shift in the wrong direction,
  which affected the calculation of HaveBottomTwoPair.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_NumberOfUnknownSuitedOvercards didn't search for overcards
  to heros holecards, but to the high card of the flush(draw).
  This affected the result of HaveNutFlushDraw, etc.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- RaisesbeforeOurFirstActionPreflopInbigBlind was wrong.
  This affected the symbol Raises if we were in big blind.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting.
  [THF]
- Bracketify.pl split InBigBlind etc. into two words,
  even if it was part of a larger lexeme (like UserVillainBigBlind).
  Thanks to Jaredlee for reporting.

MAINTENANCE:
- Some symbols like Raises depend on game-history.
  They get calculated and updated whenver the autoplayer acts.
  However: the autoplayer can possibly act more than once per turn
  (because of incorrect delay settings or too many buttons in ManualMode)
  which could throw the calculation off.
  To prevent this we do now remember the gamestate
  (by dealerchair, pot and currentbet) and do only update the symbols
  if at least one of these symbols did change.
  This way the calculation of more complex symbols
  should become way more stable. 
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- Support for specific suits in hand-expressions, 
  e.g. "WHEN Hand = AcTh" or "WHEN Hand = AdK".
