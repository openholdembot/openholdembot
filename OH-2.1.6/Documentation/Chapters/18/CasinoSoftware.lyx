Casino software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the casino software demands admin privs to install/update/run, and if
 you've successfully accomplished all 12 of these steps, then their software
 running as admin cannot automatically read your stealth drive(s) / folder(s)
 - the contents are very much private.
 However, if they are running as admin they could physically take ownership
 of the folder in order to gain access.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, it must be said that such an event could be viewed as a
 criminal act in that there is absolutely no need whatsoever for their software
 to decide to "take" physical ownership of a folder just because it wants
 to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An advanced step (not covered in this article) is to install/enable file/folder
 monitoring/auditing that will allow you to track anything that happens
 to your "safe" folder.
 Note that doing this would not stop admin/casino software from taking ownership
 but you'd have a record of the event which is better than nothing.
