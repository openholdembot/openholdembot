<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >OpenHoldem and its supporting applications do not come with an installer.
This is by design &#8211; installers tend to leave traces on your system, and in this
hobby, the less traces, the better. Stealth will be discussed in greater depth in a
later section, but this installer-less install is an important part of the stealth
strategy.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Since you do not have an installer to do the work for you, there are several steps you
need to take to correctly configure the software on your machine:
           <ol  class="enumerate1" >
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">Create   your   &#8220;OpenHoldem&#8221;   base   directory.   For   purposes   of   this
        walkthrough, we will create this directory as &#8220;c:\mpb&#8221; (&#8220;My Poker Bot&#8221;
        &#8211; clever, eh?). You can make this directory anything you want, however
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1004x2">Under c:\mpb, create another directory &#8220;c:\mpb\scraper&#8221;; this directory
        is  used  by  the  &#8220;Green  Circle  Button&#8221;   to  automagically  connect
        OpenHoldem  to  a  poker  table.  More  on  this  later.  There  is  a
        non-automagic way to connect to tables, but at this point, you probably
        want this directory.
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1006x3">Download the compiled binary packages. They can be found at the links
        in the {References} section
           </li>
        <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1008x4">Extract all the files from the compiled binary packages into the c:\mpb
        directory.  When  done,  your  directory  should  look  something  like  this,
        depending of course, on which programs you chose to extract.</li></ol>
