If possible try to install and run the casino with a normal, i.e. restricted user-account and not as administrator. If the casino software demands admin privileges to install/update/run, and if you’ve successfully configured your ninja-folder, then their software running as admin cannot automatically read your stealth drive(s) / folder(s) without physically taking ownership of the folder in order to gain access.

However most online casinos EULAs are notoriously vague when it comes to the measures they are allowed to take. The most openly discussed ones is looking in your browser history, or taking screenshots of your desktop. These are also both illegal in most countries but most casinos do it.

An advanced step (not covered in this article) is to install/enable file/folder monitoring/auditing that will allow you to track anything that happens to your "safe" folder. Note that doing this would not stop admin/casino software from taking ownership but you’d have a record of the event and would be warned which is better than nothing.
