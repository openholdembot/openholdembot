<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Autoplayer preferences control how the OpenHoldem Autoplayer functions. See the {The
Autoplayer} section for more information.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Frame delay</span>: This parameter specifies how many simultaneous identical
        screen scrapes must occur prior to the Autoplayer taking action. Generally,
        you want to have a stable poker screen before your take action, and this
        setting will allow various animations and so forth to finish, ensuring that
        your poker logic has correct game state information prior to making a
        decision.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">SWAG Delay, select to delete</span>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines
        how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing
        the  SWAG  Select  action  as  specified  in  the  Table  Map,  and  prior  to
        performing the SWAG Delete action as specified in the Table Map. These
        preferences  are  not  set  in  the  Table  Map  itself,  as  these  are  highly
        dependent on your CPU and network capacity and utilization, and thus
        are largely specific to your particular computing environment.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">SWAG Delay, delete to entry</span>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines
        how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing
        the  SWAG  Delete  action  as  specified  in  the  Table  Map  and  prior  to
        performing the SWAG Entry action. These preferences are not set in the
        Table Map itself, as these are highly dependent on your CPU and network
        capacity and utilization, and thus are largely specific to your particular
        computing environment.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">SWAG Delay, entry to confirm</span>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines
        how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing
        the SWAG Entry action, and prior to performing the SWAG Confirm
        action as specified in the Table Map. These preferences are not set in the
        Table Map itself, as these are highly dependent on your CPU and network
        capacity and utilization, and thus are largely specific to your particular
        computing environment.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Engage Autoplayer automatically</span>: This setting instructs OpenHoldem to
        automatically start the Autoplayer when it has identified the user&#8217;s chair.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Detect loss of focus on SWAG</span>: The SWAG action is the longest running
        of the poker actions, due to the need to select the text, delete it, enter the
        bet and confirm it. Occasionally, focus will be lost from the table that the
        SWAG action is being executed on, either due to multi-tabling (maybe the
        casino is set up to pop the table that requires your attention to the front?),
        or perhaps due to you or your Automation solution clicking elsewhere
        when the Autoplayer was working. When this loss of focus occurs, and if
        this setting is checked, then OpenHoldem will cancel the current SWAG

        attempt and retry on the next scrape cycle.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Use &#8216;comma&#8217; instead of &#8216;dot&#8217;</span>: Some casinos require the use of the &#8220;comma&#8221;
        as a decimal separator rather than the &#8220;dot&#8221;. This setting will instruct
        OpenHoldem to use a comma if needed. Eventually this setting should be
        moved to the Table Map file itself, as it is casino-specific.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Only calculate standard function on my turn</span>: Normally, OpenHoldem will
        calculate the primary functions on every scrape cycle. This setting will
        instruct OpenHoldem to only calculate these primary functions when it
        is  your  turn  (card  faces  and  action  buttons  are  present).  It  will  also
        prevent the calculation of most of the CPU expensive symbols including
        prwin/prlos/prtie, however the handrank symbols will be calculated as
        these are commonly used in the f$prefold calculations. f$prefold and f$play
        are still evaluated regardless if it is your turn or not.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ecti-1000">Only act with balance stability</span>: In previous versions of OpenHoldem, the
        Autoplayer would act even if you had critical misscrapes. Once of those
        critical misscrapes is a missing player balance, due to the balance box
        changing to &#8220;All-In&#8221; instead of zero, for example, when a player goes all
        in. Enabling this option will prevent the Autoplayer from acting when a
        balance misscrape is detected. If you do not require balance information
        in your bot logic, you can safely leave this box unchecked.</li></ul>
