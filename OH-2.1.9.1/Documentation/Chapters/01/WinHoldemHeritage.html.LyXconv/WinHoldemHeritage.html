       &#8220;For the first couple of years of its existence WH (WinHoldEm)
       was actively developed and developed an enthusiastic following.
       Although  it  was  a  commercial  product  Ray  Bornert  put  in  an
       astonishing amount of time answering queries on the WH BBS, and
       seemed to respond to opinions and requests there pretty quickly.
       One of the features he introduced were private forums (fora) which
       groups  could  request  and  then  run  their  own  discussions  and
       developments within them. These must have been problem children
       for him. because there was a measure of falling-out, squabbling and
       bad blood within them. The biggest and most active of these was
       the infamous Lab1.
       <!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >     The first sign of Ray&#8217;s movement away from the total nurture
       and support role was the introduction of Winscrape, a utility to
       enable the creation of profiles (Table maps). In principle WH users
       were  then  not  completely  dependent  on  him  to  generate  table
       maps. This was probably motivated by the increasing tendency
       of  pokersites  to  change  their  client  display  slightly  at  frequent
       intervals, and maintaining table maps must have been an increasing
       burden  for  Ray.  After  a  period  he  then  stopped  creating  table
       maps  altogether,  and  threw  the  users  onto  their  own  abilities
       with Winscrape. A market economy around them was supposed to
       develop.
       <!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >     There were external WH groups by this time. Ray had closed
       down the labs, saying that he did not want to be in the position
       of one who could be accused of spying on their work, and forced
       them  to  find  alternative  homes.  The  only  one  which  did  this
       permanently and successfully was Lab1; ending up on a host run by
       a mysterious presence called MaxinMontreal. The external market
       economy for table maps did not work very well, because Ray had
       put no mechanism in WH to enable maps to be given an equivalent
       of DRM, and piracy and strife soon occurred.
       <!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >     These   three   threads   combined   to   generate   a   lot   of
       dissatisfaction  amongst  the  dedicated  WH  users.  The  focus  of
       this was in Lab1. The practical result was that a certain element
       produced a WH functional clone to seed an open source project
       called  OpenHoldem.  An  open  source  equivalent  of  Winscrape
       followed.
       <!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >     This gamble seems to have paid off. There has always been
       a  dichotomy  in  botters  between  their  interests  in  collaborating
       to develop techniques, and their interest in protecting the final
       commercial results - the bots. Lab1 helped enormously by making
       their table maps non-commercial. This established the precedent

       that the infrastructure for a bot was a community responsibility
       and development. People seem to have accepted this as a good
       working  model.As  to  the  hatred  -  the  major  OH  protagonists
       acknowledge their debt to Ray for WH, and the only comment that
       Ray has made about OH is that you cannot compete with open
       source.&#8221;
