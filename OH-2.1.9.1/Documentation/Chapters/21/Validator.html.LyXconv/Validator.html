<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Validator preferences control various aspects of OpenHoldem&#8217;s Validator engine. See the
{Validator} section for more information. This is a new feature in OpenHoldem version
2.0. The purpose of the Validator is to help people to develop more reliable bots and
Table Maps. It will execute several hundred consistency-checks at the symbol level to
detect invalid game-states, mis-scrapes or incomplete information. The Validator will
write possible problems to the log-file and also show a message box, as long as
messages are not disabled. The rules used by the Validator are always being refined
and developed. The discussion forum is the best place to keep on top of this

<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Enable Validator</span>: This preference determines when the Validator is engaged to do its
work, either never (completely off), when it is my turn, or always.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Use Heuristic Rules</span>: Some rules are heuristic, i.e. they are "common sense", but not
always true. Example: A game does usually not last longer than 2 minutes, so the
autoplayer has to act at least once per 120 seconds. If it does not do so, there seems to
be a problem. Maybe the Table Map does not detect the players cards or the buttons.
This setting can result in false positives and is recommended for testing only, but not for
real-money-play.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">Stop Autoplayer on error</span>: If the Validator discovers an inconsistency, and this
preference is checked, the Autoplayer will be instructed to stop autoplaying.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ecti-1000">!!! Shoot replay-frame on error: </span>If the Validator discovers an inconsistency, and this
preference is checked, OpenHoldem will shoot a replay-frame and store it in the
replay-folder. The replay frame will help you to find the source of the error.
