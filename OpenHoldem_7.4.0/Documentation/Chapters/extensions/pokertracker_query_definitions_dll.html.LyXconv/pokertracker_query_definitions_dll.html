As you might have noticed a new DLL is part of OpenHoldem since version 4.2.0: PokerTracker_Query_Definitions.DLL. <a class="FlexURL" href="http://code.google.com/p/openholdembot/source/browse/trunk/PokerTracker_Query_Definitions/">http://code.google.com/p/openholdembot/source/browse/trunk/PokerTracker_Query_Definitions/</a> This DLL provides the ability to extend the set of PokerTracker-stats easily. The interesting part of the DLL is the file PokerTracker_Queries_Version_4.which h contains the definition of a struct:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">typedef struct t_QueryDefinition {    
    CString name;    
    CString description_for_editor;    
    CString first_part_of_query;    
    // The queries will be created on the fly,    
    // for both ring-games and tournaments.    
    // There will be an "infix" added, depending on game-type    
    CString last_part_of_query;    
    int stat_group;    
    bool needs_infix_and_second_part; 
};
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<ul>
<li>
"name" should be self-explanatory. It is something like "icon" or "vpip". 
</li>
<li>
"description_for_editor" is the explanation that will be shown in OpenHoldems formula-editor. 
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;query&rdquo; is is the database-query, usually containing one or more 3 place-holders %GAMETYPE% , %SITEID% and %SCREENNAME%. OpenHoldem will build the complete query on the fly and automatically replace these place-holders by the correct values. A nice side-effect of this new concept: all stats will automatically work for both ring-games and tournaments; therefore OpenHoldem does no longer distinguish between "pt_" and "ptt_" stats, simply &ldquo;pt_&rdquo; will always work.
</li>
<li>
"stat_group": this is one of pt_group_basic / pt_group_advanced / pt_group_positional. Diffferent groups of stats need different sample-sizes to become meaningful or change significantly. Therefore OpenHoldem will evaluate these symbols with different update delays depending on the number of hands a user has played to achieve a good compromise between meaningful stats and a low database-usage. 
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
And all the rest happens automagically. To add a new stat you only have to change the constant
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">const int k_number_of_pokertracker_stats = 29;
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
and append your stat to the array
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">t_QueryDefinition query_definitions[k_number_of_pokertracker_stats] = 
{    
    /* PT4 query to get icon */    
    {       
        // name       
        "icon",          
        // description_for_editor 		
        "Poker Tracker auto-rate icon code", 		
        // query 		
        "SELECT val_icon as result \ 		 
        FROM   player \ 		 
        WHERE  id_site = %SITEID% AND \ 		        
        player_name LIKE ’%SCREENNAME%’", 		
        // stat_group 		
        pt_group_basic 	
    }, 
    /* PT4 query to get number of hands in the database */ 	
    { 		
        // name 		
        "hands",
        ...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
After the coding work has been done you need to compile the DLL and put it together with the linker-file (*.lib) into the OpenHoldem directory and everything will work automatically: querying the database, accessing the values in your bot-logic, correct update delays, even the symbol-descriptions in the formula-editor. Despite of its simplicity this approach has some more benefits:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
it is update-safe. If a new version of OpenHoldem gets released your DLL will work as before without you having to compile a modified version of OpenHoldem or missing important bug-fixes. 
</li>
<li>
you can add stats without having to wait for new releases. 
</li>
<li>
you can easily contribute to make OpenHoldem better for everyone.
</li>

</ul>
