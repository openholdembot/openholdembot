	"OpenPPL does not provide any default bot logic,\n"

	"However: if you don't need all 4 sections\n"

	// k_error_missing_brackets_for_card_expression
	"Our parser is a bit greeddy.\n"

	"WHEN Hand = TT AND...RAISE Force\n" 
	"WHEN Board = 456 CALL FORCE\n"
	"\n"
	"In the first case it will take the \"A\" of \"AND\" as an ace,\n"
	"in the second case it will take \"6 C\" as a 6 of clubs.\n"

	// k_error_missing_brackets_for_when_condition
	"We are sorry, but for technical reasons\n"
	"all conditions need to be enclosed in brackets.\n"

	"Sole exception: WHEN Others FOLD FORCE\n",

	//k_error_invalid_character,
	"At or near the critical code location is at least one invalid character.\n"

	"that you simply forgot a space, e.g.\n"
	"\"ASUITED\" instead of \"A SUITED\".\n",

	// k_error_operator_instead_of_action
	"We expect an action here, but found an operator,\n"
	"but most likely you just forgot another pair of brackets here.\n"
