	"\n"
	"WHEN Hand = TT AND...RAISE Force\n" 
	"WHEN Board = 456 CALL FORCE\n"
	"\n"
	"In the first case it will take the \"A\" of \"AND\" as an ace,\n"
	"in the second case it will take \"6 C\" as a 6 of clubs.\n"

	// k_error_missing_brackets_for_when_condition
	"We are sorry, but for technical reasons\n"
	"all conditions need to be enclosed in brackets.\n"
